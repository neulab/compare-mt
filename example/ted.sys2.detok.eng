The end of this year is going to be about billions of people actively use sites of social media.
The only thing that everybody's common is that they die.
Even though it might be a little bit of a clamina thought, I think it's a serious impact that tries to explore.
This was my first time took me this year from Derete K. (Applause) Maile, scientific and technological journalist that he died in cancer.
And Mille dropped his family and I knew that they were published while she died.
This writn in the front page.
"He said," "That's right here. I'm dead, and this is my final favorite party."
"And I asked when my body finally touched my body and my friends and friends published this in a visualization text — like the first part of the process of transforming this active page to the acoustics." "As a journalist, a Nicey military was sort of worth the faculty and delivered more sophisticated than others, but the point is that now we all create apathy that's a completely different thing
Think about a few statistics.
Right now, every minute, is 48 hours of video recording recording YouTube.
We're going to send 200 million tweets every day.
And the average user creates 90 pieces of content every month.
When you think about your parents and grandparents, they're going to make a few photos or home video or a day that's experiencing somewhere in the box.
But today, we're all creating this incredibly rich digital structure that survives in the cycle limits, and then we're going to be gone.
And I think it's a couple of very unusual possibilities for technologies.
I'm a journalist, I'm a journalist, so I'd just like to wait as the presence and the future looks like.
What we're seeing now now is some services that allow us to decide what happens with our online profiles and connective social milkweed to our death.
One of them, quite screwed, I found myself when I jumped into the bench in New York City on Farsquequare.
"[" "Anhhh MBA:" "Halo."
Death: Adam?
Adam Oprlow: Um oh.
Death: Buming you awake, even though, even organic food.
Adam Opruck: Who is it?
Death: Go toomed.
(Laughter) A bit scary, isn't it?
This wish, you just allow you to create a message or video that can send Facebook to Facebook when you die.
Another epidemic is called 1,000 Memifics.
It allows you to create an online memory for your loved ones, they're hooked with images and video games and the stories that they can publish when you die.
But I think what's next is much more interesting than that.
You probably knew Dela Roya, who showed this year that he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of an opera video.
I think the way machines of machines understand human language and processing big data ranges continue to improve the area of life — tweets, images, videos, blogs, blogs, blogs that we're producing in such masterpieces.
And I think if that happens, it's going to be possible for our digital writings in an interaction with real understanding of how we leave, and this is because of a huge amount of content we make and the ability of technologies that we make it understand all of it.
We're already starting to see some experiments.
"" "Fax Tweet artist" "— everything you sent to Twitter so that you could predict what you could say next."
Well, right now, you can see, the results are a little bit problematic.
But you can imagine something like five or 10 or 20 years, with the idea of making our technical skills.
We're going to go further, media laboratory at MIT works on governments that can integrate more human humanity.
But what if these robots knew about unique traits based on a variety of thousands of thousands of disciplines that the person would produce for their life?
Eventually, remember a famous scene at night 2008, 2008 in the United States, where a CNN parod a living hologram hit by the musical Park Yark.
What if we were to be able to use this kind of resonance technology to connect our missions to our habits and interact in a very alive form based on an area that we created during life?
I think that's going to happen really possible, because I'm going to spend data that we use and technological opportunity to understand exponentially.
Finally, I think we need to think about whether we want this reality — and if they do, what it means for the definition of life and all that comes from.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Today I'm going to talk about the unexpected discoveries.
I work in a solar-engeric industry.
My little new business is trying to lead to care about the environment, and that's why...
... and so in order to exploit the possibility of crowdsourcing.
It's just a little video of what we do.
Honey. Remember.
It can take a moment to stop it.
(Laughter) We can — we can jump a little bit further — I mean, I just click that video) (Laughter)
No. (Laughter) (Laughter)
(Music) This is not — (Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter)
The exciting technology is...
So my time has already drained?
Okay. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The second is from the head.
The answer is yes.
Then you can do the projections and to test them.
So what do we know about complexity?
So the whole thing is literally more than the sum of its particles.
Where are economic networks?
We have focused on a grid of ownership.
We're selves.
How are the arrangements? They're isolated?
These are the community geeks in a variety of countries, and we've found them 4,0000,000.
I'm going to explain that in this example.
Hi. Today, we're going to go to my about eight projects that I've done in partnership with the Danish artist State Technology.
We're going to talk about Nature & Rao and we're working and we're working in India.
"I'm going to hear my first subject that I call" "multi-tellon." "He was inspired by a strange habit of my ceiling asking me to do something, almost as if I was an extension of his body — in order to meet the lights, brought a glass water or a crab a cigarette."
And as I grew up, it was always worse and worse, and I began to see it as a form of control.
But of course, I could never know anything, because uncle is an respected person in India.
And what I did most of what I didn't understand was the way he was using phones.
He kept a head off, and he was expected to hear his number.
"So as a reaction to do that, and as a gift for my waist, I made" "multi-tellooon." "It's so long that they need to take two people."
It's the sensible shoe of how my uncle uses a phone design for one person.
But the problem is, when I left my house and went to college, my uncle was missing.
So I made him a unique writing machine, with which he could produce his commands of the spokes and don't spend across the world in the form of email.
So they had to take paper, they strike it on a flag, render the email or the present and pull paper out.
He committed to a glass person called a email.
So here you can see that we've done a lot of electronics that understand all the mechanical activities and bring them to digital.
So my uncle works just with mechanical interface.
And of course, this object must be big and have a siege of terrorism, just like my uncle is like my uncle.
"The next piece is an installation in the sound that we call" "Pygmother." "And we wanted to work with the idea that we were surrounded by the trunks of very shallow, fragile and decomposed creatures."
And it works that we have these panels on these panels and hide these kinds of creators.
If they're silence, they're like this.
If you're even quieter, then they attract diseases.
And at the most intense sound, they're going to discuss again.
These panels have been on three walls of the room.
They were hiding over 500 of these little pygrooms.
It works like this.
This is a video of a prototype.
When silence is silence, slowly following the panels.
And they hear as people or living creators.
So after a while they become immune to the sounds that they have.
And they don't rat on the sounds.
You're going to hear trains that they don't ratize.
(Halk) But they're interacting for sounds in progress. You'll be heard of it.
(Cheers) So we have worked hard to create what's most magical.
Every single dog has their own behavior, the psychiatrists, the mood swings, personality, and so forth.
This is a very early prototype.
Of course, that's pretty good.
And we made them respond to people, but we learned that people like to play with them.
"This is a video installation called" "invisible person." "And they're interested in playing with the idea of the invisible idea."
What would that be invisible?
So we've been working with a society that specializes on cameras and asked them to develop the software, using cameras that would look at people in the room, watch them and one person replaced the background that causes its invisible.
I'm going to show you a very early prototype.
To the right, I see my colleague Peter, which is in the space.
And what you're going to see on the left is a processed video where the camera is manipulated.
The nurse goes into the room. He's barely invisible.
You can see that the camera's watching it and Mom.
It's a very early video, so we haven't yet fixed the curves and all around that, but then that's where it hits quite quickly.
We used it in a room where cameras were looking into space, and we had one monitor.
And when people went to the room, they saw an airplane monitoring, with one difference: one person was still invisible to move through the room.
"This is a work called" "The Sun of the Sun." "And that was almost like a mass paper, like he had 43 cartoons of oil or the sun."
The front of the deal seemed to be very strong and robust and zunky to become very weak.
So people came in the room and nearly ignored that they're some wastes that they're arguing there.
But as soon as they've gone around, it becomes the steeping movement to the wall.
And it's never been going back and knocked down.
(Laughter) So this work is a cartoon for the transfunted guy.
His head is so difficult, full hard ideas that he sort of dropped into his hat and his body grows up almost as a plant.
And the thing is, it's moving around a very sharp way, in a very unexpected and extremely slow motion.
And it's likely limited to this circle.
Because if this circle wasn't there, and the floor would be very flat, it would start plugping around space.
There are no wires.
I'm going to show you an example — so when people go into the room, they're activated this object.
And a few minutes, very slowly, that's kind of freezing upside down, and then it starts to catch up, and it seems like it had to fall every minute.
This is a big moment, because we wanted to make the view of instinctively to help and help the object.
But that doesn't need it, because it's sort of going up again.
So this work has been a real test on us, and we worked on it very tough, like most of our jobs, all years, equals, equals and dynamics worked right.
It was very important for us to create that moment, when it's almost a long time, because if we did it so that it would be kicked, and if it didn't seem fanciful enough, it wouldn't justify that Facebookism or the feeling of wanting to go and help it.
I'm going to show you a very short video where we do a test — it's much faster than that.
That's my colleague. He did it.
It's now starting to be nervous, so it's going to shake it.
But it wasn't because they could pick it up.
This is the work that we've been very interested in processing the troop deployment that we've stored in thousands of tiny optical fibers that shine across the night sky.
And it's so much patterns to look like a night sky.
We've gone around this kind of paletical form that's in the shape of a shallow locker that incorporated from the ceiling.
Melind was something delicious to something very cold and distant and abstraction, like the universe with something very famous, like a palette, which is very comforting and close.
And what we've done is that in some point you're going to stop looking at the shape of a lock and you start to view it as a hole in space, and you look at the glowing room of the sky.
"This is the last work that still does, and it's called" "Space creation." "Now imagine a little cube that's roughly big, stands in front of you in the middle of the room, and if you zoom in there, you're trying to intimidate you by growing into the cube that's twice as well, and it &apos
This object expands constantly expanding and deeply injured to create a dynamic with people traveling around — almost seeming to hide secret or something like that.
So we're working with lots of technologies, although we don't like technology, because we don't worry about it.
But we use it because we care about the way we can communicate emotions and behavior in these kinds of creatures that we construct.
And in the moment, as a statement of mind, it's almost like the process of design, to discover the way that this creator is going to be and how the form wants to have and how they want to move.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I love the Internet.
It's true.
Think about everything that brought us.
Think about all the services we use, all those connections, all the fun, all the stores, all the stores.
And that's what's happening over our lives.
I'm sure that one day we're going to talk about whistles, hundreds of years from now, and generation will be a generation that has become online, generation that has built something and really global.
But yeah, it's also true that the Internet has problems, very serious problems, problems with security and problems with privacy.
I've spent my career struggling with these problems.
Let me show you something.
This is Brinin.
This is a discussion — five and a quarter-pired discussion infected by the virus of Brin A.
It's the first virus that we found for personal computers.
And we know where Bandin came from.
We know because it's written in the code.
Let's see.
Okay.
"This is the" "junk community." "And if we look closer, we'll see exactly this saying," "Please in the cave." "And it continues to say" "1986," "Bajat and Hello."
He chills and Heiks are names, Pakistan names.
In fact, there's a phone number and a peanut in Pakistan.
(Laughter) Well, a year 1986.
It's 2011.
That's 25 years.
The problem of computer viruses has 25 years old.
A few years ago, I decided to go to Pakistan.
Let's see, here's a few photos from my childhood in Pakistan.
This is the town of Lahore, which is about 300 miles away from the Abbbatbab, where the Bin Laden captured.
This is a typical street.
And here's a street or a way to lead to this building, which is 75 Nizan to Alma Iquba.
I went to the door.
(Laughter) Do you want to guess who open doors?
And Ahm and Ahmond; they're still there.
(Laughter) (Applause) This is Baust.
They're sitting in his brother's brother.
These are the guys who wrote the first computer virus.
We had a very interesting discussion.
I wondered why.
I wondered what they were arguing about.
And so I realized a little bit when I discovered that the Batit and Anima had replicated their computers by completely strangers by strangers during those years.
So there's some movement in the world.
We're not a problem in the '80s and 90s.
I'm going to show you some examples how they used to look.
What I'm here to do is the system that allows me to initiate the ancient programs on a modern computer.
I plug some disks. I'm going to plug.
Here's a list of an old virus list.
So I'm going to teach a few viruses on my computer.
Let's take a first place in the volunteers.
And you can see on the top of the screen, the 100-oce is running through your computer when it's infected.
You know you were infected because you show it.
Here's another one. That's the virus Caiseh.
I'm going to show you one that makes some noise.
(Holk) And the last example, guess what makes the virus Walmer.
Yes, there's a virgin walking over the screen when it's infected.
So it used to know that you were infected with viruses when writing viruses were writing and teenagers.
They're no longer written by amateurs and teenagers.
Today, the viruses are a global problem.
What we have here is an example of our system that runs in our labs where we're tracking viruses in the world.
We can see in real time that we have blocked viruses from Sweden and Tamarane and Russia and allwhere else.
In fact, when I go back to our system, we can see in real time as much viruses, how much new examples of the damage programs we find every day.
Here's the latest virus that we found in Server.
We found him directly here, three seconds ago — the previous one, six seconds ago.
And when we go through that, it's just massive.
We're finding ten thousands, even hundreds of thousands.
And that's the last 20 minutes of Gold programs, every single day.
So where do all they come from?
Well, they're organized with a group of papers that write these viruses because they earn them.
They're a group like — let's go to GangtaBucks.com.
It's a web running in the Mozlf, where these people are infected by the board of a computer.
So when you're a battery and you're capable of spare computers with Windows, but you don't know what you can sell with them — somebody else's other computers — these people.
And they're really paying money for the computer.
And how do they burn these infected computers?
Well, it's a multiple way of banking thrusters that steal money from your online bank accounts when you use online banking or cylorgs.
Kyloger's desk sitting in your computer, stuck and give everything you write.
You're sitting in your computer and looking at Google.
Every single finding that you're signing about is called a permanent criminality.
Anyone who's tweeting is they're listed and sending a crime.
Same thing is true for each battle, and so forth.
But what they're most, they're chasming — Shhh, when you're online and online, you shopp in some online store.
"This is why you price your online, writing your name," "Please write your" "advertisement," "number in your payload and security code for the payrolls."
And here's an example of a set that we found in the server a few weeks ago.
This is a number of plate cards, data specimens, security code, and this is the name of cards.
Once you get access to the information of other people, you can buy an online to buy what you want to do with these data.
And apparently, that's a problem.
There's a pool of black markets in the ground, a business ecosystem built around online crime.
So one example of how these people are able to burn their operations, and let's look at the pages of ITTPOL, and look at the face of the person.
We're going to find people if Brador Surnik, the origin of Sweden, and his partner in crime, also on the list of UNTEROL, Mr. Shadapshem, sometimes the U.S..
These two have been followed by the operation called I.M.U., cyber surgery that they earned millions.
They're both on the run.
No one knows where they are.
The American assistant, just a few weeks ago, the Swiss Bank accounts against Mr. Jan and the account of the showed 14.9 million dollars.
So the volume that generates online crime is significant.
And that means that online criminals can afford investing in their attacks.
We know that online criminal soldiers hire programmers, they recruit the code, they're testing their code with QLL databases.
And they can afford to watch as we do — people from security — and they're trying to find the way around any security policies that we think.
They also change the global nature of the Internet on their advantages.
The Internet is an international one.
That's why the Internet is called.
And if you look at what's happening in online world, here's a video from Calflower, which illustrates as a group of working with the monolithal software can move around the globe.
This operation, an aspirational origin has in Eston, is moving from one country to another country to harvest their pages.
These people just aren't supposed to show up.
The jump from one country to another person, one of the funders in another — they travel around the world, using the fact that we don't have the luxury of global warming operations like this.
The Internet is like someone gave a loose ticket all online in the world.
The headlines that they didn't know before to touch us.
So, how do we actually look for online crimes?
You see them.
Let me give you an example.
Here's one set to use security holes — an explondiction.
I'm looking at the x-ax display of a screen that's got an expedition.
What this means is, if you look at this slide in your computer with Windows, let's take your computer and start the code.
If you look at this image — that's a screenhead, and here's where the actual code of the attack.
And that code was encrypted, so we disassemble it.
They've used the encryption of the X2N.
You just have to believe, it's the case.
We can go here and start doing flourishing.
The yellow part of the code are now decreated.
And I know it doesn't seem too different from the original.
But just look at it.
So here you see the webflower down the street — / minus / AIDS, and if you open this slide on your computer, he actually drains and promises that program.
"It's called" "guilty" "— security bug that causes your computer."
But even more interesting is we're continuing in deference, we find this mysterious sequence, O600KOSS.
The code is under encryption as some sign.
It doesn't work on anything.
And as I looked at it, I tried to find out what it means.
I figured out.
He didn't come out. He was not there.
So I talked to people with our lab.
"We have a couple of Ruses, and one of them said," "It's going to end up at" "Huss" "as Russia."
"" "78" "is the code of the city, the city of Singapore."
You can find it in a phone number, for example, wearing cars and so forth.
So I set out contacting in St. Peter Foundation, and after long, we finally got to this one gossip website.
So here's this Russ that's online for a few years, it's a center, and it's blogging at the popular Lincoln.
And this blog blogging about his life, his life in her dreams. (Laughter) He has something over 20 — his mother, his girlfriend.
And it has a very nice car.
This young ride on Merces-Bunt provinces with six million horses and more than 400 horses.
That's a really nice car on a 20-year-old boy from Singapore. Pendupu.
How do I know about that?
Because she's blogging about his car.
He also had an accident.
In the center of St. Peteriorado, he scattered his car in another car.
And he gave a blog posted pictures of this accident — that's his Meracades — that's the Lad Samura touched.
And you can see that the marker of Samary ends up at 77RS.
And if we look at the image of whole scenes, you can see that the name is O600K.
"I'm not a lawyer, but if I was there, I would say," "It's clear." "(Laughter) What happens when there are online staff?"
Well, most cases don't get so far.
Most of the cases online, we don't know where the continents are coming from.
And although it's going to be used to find the crimes, it's not quite often nothing from all of this.
Sea police doesn't end or if he's wrong, or maybe it's not monsters, or some reasons we cannot celebrate them.
I wish to be easier; unfortunately, it isn't.
But things are changing in a very high range.
You've heard things like SOLcatt.
If you look at what Stextine did, he proved this.
That's Dr.74 PLC, a programmable state of a management unit.
And that's what's changing our infrastructure.
That's changing all around us.
Peter, these little boxes that don't have a port or a keyboard, they're programmed, banked, and they do their job.
So, for example, the elevator in this building are probably controlled with something like this.
And when Statex withdraws took some of them, that's a massive revolution in the kinds of risks we have to care about.
Because all around us is ruled.
I mean, it's a critical infrastructure.
You go to farms, power plants, chemistry plants, factories to food, you're looking at it — everything begins to be shipped by computers.
Everything is controlled by the computer.
Everything relies on that the computer is working.
We became very addicted to the Internet, based on the basic things as electroly, apparently, as working computers.
And that's something that makes us really new problems.
We have to have some way of chasing in work while computers fail.
(Laughter) (Applause) Now this means we can do things with things that we choose for that.
It's actually very basic — think about the continuory, about the things that really matter.
I told you — (Laughter) I love the Internet. Very.
Think about all the services that are available online.
Think of it if you were screwed if you didn't have one day, or if you didn't have any reason.
I see beauty in the future of the Internet, but I fear we don't see it.
I suspect we're going to have problems with online crime.
The actual crime is one thing that these things can pick up.
(Laughter) I spent my life going into the Internet, and I really feel that if we don't have a race online, we risk that we lose everything.
We have to do it globally, and we have to do it right now.
What we need is more global, international discrimination, to search for gang warfare — these organized gangs making their attacks on their attacks.
That's much more important than we use anti-virus and purple.
What really matters is to find people behind these attacks, and more importantly, we need to find people who become part of this world online crime, but they aren't yet.
We need to find people with abilities, but without disabilities, and give them opportunities to make their voices better.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I would like to start by offering you and the only thing you need to do is that two minutes change your mindset.
But before I communicate that, I want you to invite you to check your bodies and what you do with it.
How many of you do you check?
Sometimes we're holding your hands.
Sometimes we expand. (Laughter) I see you. (Laughter)
So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing.
We're fascinated by the speech of the body, and we're particularly interested in it.
You know, they're interested in us, you know — (Laughter) — vanishing interactions or smiles, hhaking, or maybe a very strange value or even something like bucking hands.
Children: It's coming down to Doad 10 and look.
Even for BBC and The New York Times.
So naturally, when we think about non-verbal, or the body of the body — but as a science scientist, we're talking about non-verbaln — it's speech, so we have a communicating mechanism.
If we think of communication, we think about interactions.
And there's lots of reasons to believe that this is the right thing?
And in terms of the body, we create lots of opinions and conclusions.
These judgments can predict a really meaningful environment, like whom we save or encourage anyone we're going to call date.
For example, Naliá Abbady, a survey from the University of Turkse shows that when people watchout the sound of the 30-second escalation table between physician and patients, their opinions at the negotiating physician predicted whether or not the physician would be closed.
If you use them wrong, it's worse.
We're also our squirbralism, our ideas, our feelings, our physiology.
What do I tell you about the non-verbald displays?
I'm a writer. I study prejudice and I'm teaching my business school with competition, so it doesn't seem to be trying to care about pensions of power.
I began to care particularly about non-celled gestures and bornmines.
What are the non-verbal of power and born?
In the realm of animals, it's expanding.
You're going to make big, you take your space, you're basically opening up.
It's opening up. And this is true.
This speech that's known as a pian, a study named Jessica Traacy.
We're changing. We don't want to go to the person next to us.
And this is what happens when you merge a lot of it.
So when someone's very powerful at us, we tend to shrink down. We don't do the same thing that they do.
I see this behavior in class, and what have I noticed? I've noticed that they're MBAs.
When they find out, they become a spread.
Then you have other people who don't do virtually when they're waiting. You see it immediately.
I've noticed some things on this.
It's much more likely to do things, not men.
Women is less powerful than men, so that's not surprising. But another thing I've noticed is,
This is in MonteAA very important, because the activity in the ranks is half the grades.
Green schools struggle to discuss both of two genders.
So I started thinking about it.
There's some evidence to this.
For example, we smile when we're happy, but also, if we're making the smile by holding the lipoise like teeth, the way we feel happier.
So it's okay. It's very much with power.
The second question was, because we know that our minds change our bodies — but do you think our bodies change our minds?
And when I say the mind in the case of power, what do I tell?
What looks like the mind of powerful themselves.
Humans tend to be, not surprising, more expensive and more often, more optimistic.
They have a feeling that they're going to win in the fire games.
So there's lots of differences. More risky.
But actually, it's a power to answer stress.
Would you want to be an influence, which is dominant, has a high testosterone, but hasn't the stress of stress?
Isn't that? You like a person.
So we have a proof of evidence: that the body can shape the mind, at least in terms of the face, and that change can shape the mind.
So what happens if you take a new rock, what happens if you do it at a really minimal level, how is this little manipulatation, this tiny intervention?
Here's a couple of others.
So you can stand or sit.
Here's the attitudes of signaling a small power.
You know, you're doing small.
When you touch the cows.
So it was like this.
That was everything. That was all the experiment.
We found this.
So again, two minutes and you get these changes.
"And the object will become this." "People are saying" "They" "structure."
So what seems to do is we don't just use it, so it's not just others, but also by us.
It also changes our bodies changing our minds.
We think you're using this mainization of society. Where you're value
Again, this is not about how you talk to other people.
It's a conversation with yourself. What you're doing before.
So that's what we wanted to test.
It took five minutes. We assembled them.
Have nothing at all, and that's worse than if they're disturbing you.
People hate it. It's something that Marcine Lawrence is calling
Then they looked at these recordings four dials.
They didn't know the hypothetical. They didn't recognize the conditions.
It's about making speeches that fit into speech.
Those things. People are bringing their right self.
So this leads to the effect, or a social effect.
So I'm telling them, pretend until you can't do it — I don't.
I don't want to prove it and feel like it's fraud.
I don't want to feel like a fraud fraud.
When I was 19, I survived a very tough car.
I blew my car out of my car, and I made some taps.
I blew my car out. I woke up in a repressed ward party.
I knew my IQ Q, because I was considered the smart and over the grade.
So I drop out of high and trying to go back.
"And they were sick," "They're high schools."
I'm a fraud.
You become knocked and you do that.
"I thought," "I'm doing it." "So I did." "So I did."
I don't feel it, but she is, and I know what it's like.
This may be necessary, it can be done.
So they changed.
I want to tell you, don't accept it until you can't do it.
You fake it before you do it. You know?
You do it until you really become this.
The final thing I'm going to tell you is this.
Facferences can lead to big changes.
These are two minutes.
Two minutes, two minutes, two minutes.
This is what you should do.
You're very passionate. You're making a correlation.
You don't understand your sense of judgment, you don't show them your true self.
Thank you. (Applause)
We need Big importance in time. We need lots of importance in time.
Difficacy. Great creativity is wonderful, ridiculous, rational and irrationally powerful.
Technology can spread the implementation, to support freedom, to do something like a great idea.
(Laughter) The actual creativeness can turn attention to detonation, or show that the depressation is not in the place.
The advent of thinking can make politics more relaxed or disturbable.
He could draw wars like a tragedy or a psychiatrist.
Creativity is mimicter that puts on trickle slogans and phrases into our mouths.
Creativity is a pioneer that shows us a very simple road through the unified moral molecule.
Science is a wise, but a big creativity is something less determinable about it, and now we need to be magic.
Now it's time.
Our climate changes rapidly, and very quickly.
And the big creativity is necessary to do what it does so well: to create different thoughts with dramatic, creative statements.
In order to bring us to another act that will be full of pleasely creative.
Here's one creative multi-founding proposition where I'm involved in which I'm involved with creativity inspire people to inspire people to be enough.
(Video) Man: You know, better than cars, I'm going to go today.
Narrator: And he went, and when he went, he saw things.
Wonderful and amazing things that otherwise wouldn't see.
It's a sorrowful clock. It's a motorcycle.
Dadd and daughter are separated by the chest wall.
And then she stopped. She walked right before him.
A woman who had kicked across the field and broke his heart.
Surely, since then, she was a little bit.
In fact, there's been a lot.
But he put all his old passions for her.
"" "Terror," "he said to silence. It was her name."
"" "Don't tell a word, Danisty," "she said," "he said that" "He was his name."
"" "I'm going to become a cauvan, 38 meters from here."
"Let's love there. It's going to happen." "Find out to be fought one leg, and then the other one."
And the Guatemala has chilled it, and she loved her rhythmically while she filmed him because he was a product amateur.
They're both pressed for them.
And he lived with happily to death.
And that's because they decided to go on that day.
(Applause) And they've got science, we have a debate.
The neocortic Empire is on the desk.
The actual creativity is necessary to take all the most important and things delicious.
To connect everything, and to make sense of people who want to act.
So this is a challenge or robotics, addressed an enormously talented community of TED.
Let's be creatively against climate change.
And let's do it right now. Thank you.
(Applause)
So, this game is very simple.
Everything you have to do is read, what do you see?
So I'm going to count that you don't have to do it.
One, two, three. (Video): Can you read it?
BL: It's amazing. And what? One, two, three, three. DR: This is what you do.
BL: Okay, two, two, three, three. (Laughter) They wish you to talk about the Portuguese, right? And what about this? One, two, three.
Audience: What do you read it?
BL: What do you read that? Not there any words.
"I said," "Well, what do you see. Is it so?"
"There's said," Hey, honey? "" (Laughter) Is it true? "
That's what you have to say. Why is that? Why is that?
It's because perception is rooted in our experience.
The brain takes the meaning of illegal information and evaporation from itself, which means we never see what's in fact, we don't see the information, we don't always see what's useful to see before.
That means that we're all in terms of perception, we're all like this frog.
(Laughter) They get information that's useful. (Laughter) (Video) Narrator) (Laughter) (Video) Man: A (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) BL: But if things aren't going to teach us our ideas, a little bit, right?
But now we're talking about perception.
And perception is underestimated and determines everything we know what we know, what we believe, our aspirations, our dreams, the cloths that we carry in love, everything begins with perceptual.
So if your perception is rooted in our past, we're always fundamentally reacting as much as the past.
But actually, it's a huge problem, because, how do we ever perceive differently?
I'd like to tell you a story about how you can see differently and that all new perceptions begin in the same way.
They start the question.
The problem is that they cause insecurity.
Well, uncertainty is from an evolutionary cue, if you're not sure whether or not if it's a predator, it's too late.
I don't have the right? (Laughter) Even the sea level is the result of uncertainty.
When you're on the ship, if you're your deepest ear, you're frightened. Your eyes, when he's in a boat, tell you that you're standing without causing.
Your brain doesn't know with that uncertainty and comes you wrong.
"What's called" "why?" "is one of the most dangerous questions you can put on, because he causes uncertainty."
But the irony at the same time remains that the only way to do anything new is in the space.
So, how is it possible to do something new? Well, fortunately, evolution gave us the answer.
And she enabled us to answer the hardest question: the best questions are the ones that cause the biggest uncertainty.
They're the ones that they're examining and they're asking for things that we're thinking about true. I don't have the truth?
It's easy to ask as a life, or what's behind the universe, but to ask what you're thinking about, is really what you're thinking about, is really what you're doing in space.
And what is the origin of evolution for uncertainty?
Driv.
It's not just a process. It's not just a process. It's going to tell you that it's actually a way to lead.
It's one of the man's dream where uncertainty is basically celebration. It doesn't count what's done with joy.
"It can adapt to change. It creates new choices and requires cooperation. It's basically our way of social weapons, and it's deepestly motivated. That means we play to play." "It's rewarding for yourself."
If you look at these five ways, they're exactly the kinds of ways you need to be a good priority.
Science is not defined by science fiction.
It's actually the way they're present, and this is true for everything that's creative.
So if you add the rules to play, you get a game with rules, knowledge.
And that's what we call the experiment.
So the armed ideas that science is the way to go, and that the experiment is to the edge, we asked if the scientist can become everything?
And who's another 25 or eight to 10 older children?
Because they're actually experts in the game. So I took my beyond a small school in Detroit, and the goal wasn't just until the kids could see science differently, but in order to see the science of science, they could see themselves.
The first step was to ask a question.
What I'd like to do is we haven't got any money on this study, because scientists said that little kids can't contribute to the scientific knowledge and teachers who are going to be fighting it.
But even though we've done that. Of course.
So here's some answers. So, I had cut them off to reading their readings, and the main notion is that five of the questions that the kids came, they created actually the basis of scientific audiences during the last 515 years.
They asked things that are relevant to the advanced scientists.
Now I'd like to share with someone really extraordinary.
It was one of the young people involved in this project, and now they're part of the youngest published scientists in the world, and when he comes on the stage, becomes the youngest person ever at TED.
But science and asking questions is the thing.
And she's gotten off the courage because he comes up here, and he'll be able to talk to you all.
So the Ays, could you please move here to us? (Applause) And they help a story about the Blackwood bees project, but first forgive you the question that they came, and they like.
"And they're about" "Toy," "" "Yes." "Thank you, Beau. We thought it was easy to see continuum among people and monkeys in ways we think, because we're shaped."
But they were interested in whether there's some relationship with other animals, and it would be amazing if people and bees thought they look so different.
And so we asked whether the people and bees are solving complex problems in the same way.
Indeed, we wanted to know if bees can adapt to new demands with previous disciplines and conditions. So, what if bees are they going to think of as us?
Well, it would be amazing, because we're talking about insects with one million brain cells.
But in fact, it's actually quite possible, because bees, equally, like us, they can recognize good flowers without a day, light, during the flowers of the day, the light, the weather, from which the flowers go to the flower. (Applause) BL: Okay. So the kids invented an experiment that's a game. So the kids invented an experiment,
"O: "" I wished, "" which we came up with is "" ta "" rule. "
We wanted bees to learn not only come to the flowers of particular color, but to go to the flowers of tarty colors, and only if it has a pattern.
They only get rewarded when they flew down to yellow flowers and these yellow flowers had blue limbs, or if you had blue flowers had yellow limbs.
There's a variety of ways that bees can learn to solve this puzzle. What's the interesting question is like?
What's really exciting about this project was that even Bina didn't even wish if we could work it.
It was something completely new, and no one had ever tried before, adults don't mention. (Laughter) BL: And they don't need teachers, and that's really hard for them.
For the scientist, it's easy to go into something that he'd like to share what he's doing because it's his work in a lab, but for the teacher, not seeking what's going to happen in the end of the day — very large thanks to Dave Midwick who worked on.
I won't go to the details of study because you can read it, but another step is mindfulness. Here we see how a few students are doing observation. They incorporate where honeybees fly.
(Video) Dave Spewick: So what we're going to do — the Student: 5C.
Dave Mdwick: So they're climbing up here? The student: Yes.
"Put the Silwick:" "Don't get your eyes off." "Again: Henry, can you help me to help me do?"
"BL:" "Can you come to help me, Henry?" "Which script says something like that, right?"
Student: Here's two.
And here's three.
BL: So we've done observations. They've got the data.
They've done simple mathematical expenses, they're seeing average, etc.
And we wanted to share our findings. That was another step.
We had to write them, and we first had to write them first.
We went like another, into a bar. (Laughter) Here's my eye, okay? (Laughter) I've been explaining that these birds are divided on four different elements: First, used methods and outcomes and discussions.
Leadaway to illuminate what's going to ask and why?
Meuordy, what did you do? (MK: You know what you've done?
And the discussion, it's about who care, right?
"It's in a little fancy device. (Laughter) So kids suffered, and I've written that into one whole thing, which suggests that the fiction is written by child language." "
"I didn't write it. They wrote her" "Ay and her student." "Because they'd say," "Once it's been there." "(Laughter) So in part of the emerging stations, the puzzle, inventors..." "(Laughter)
And this is the plain page. We have some authors here.
They all cited the fat writing scripts 8 to 10 year-olds.
"And as the first person, the primary school in Blackweilton, because if anyone ever suggested that study, he used" "Magckawaton and" "" "Belawawton and" "" "Time." "And so we sent it to the ceremony of the public, and then we sent it to the
"" "I'm sorry that the rustleation didn't just coine our primary control of quality, and that's several reasons." "(Laughter) Another way, it starts saying," "The numbers are written," "the numbers are written out." "
"Drarry Maldives, an expert in vision, said," "These translation is delicious."
"It would be published if someone would write it." "So we did what? We sent it back to the publisher."
He refused.
Then we created the Larry and Namplavio Homplov to comment the scientists of his findings, put them in the bikes and sent them to the masters of Biology Letters.
That's where our article read and enforced five independent observations and published it. (Applause) (Applause) The Gioty attempted four months before they published it. (Laughter) The genetic science, right? (Laughter) So the Association science, right? And so they became the youngest scientists in the world who published an article.
And what was the response?
And the article came two days before Christmas, the first day, that was squirted by 300,000 people.
It was about a Tim's University of Science, for the advance of science.
The article is still available in the masters of Biolos Letters.
It's the only wrecked story in this jarral.
Last year, that was the second to go on the colly store in Biolos Letters, against the scientists, but the teachers and the public public.
I'm just going to count one reaction.
"" "I don't read literature's" "Bamaketon's" "(Laughter) They don't stop telling me words for my feelings."
What you've done is real, true and wonderful.
curiosity, interest in publicity and enthusiastic for the thing are the most fundamental and critical prediction for every scientist.
Who has a bigger assumption than children?
"Please encourage your child's team to me." "I would like to end with a metaphor from physicists."
Can I try to try to do that? (Laughter) Okay, yeah, yeah. Let's go.
It's about risky, and this is a big risk. (Laughter) For me, not for me. Because this is why we've done this before. (Laughter) So I like technology, right?
Shakespeare: Hey, but I love myself.
BL: That's the ideal of the technology.
So... (Laughter) Okay. (Laughter) Now do we do a smaller demonstration, okay?
You have to close your eyes to show me where you'll hear me clapping me. OK?
(Honk) (Finging) Okay, what if all these screws are there, one, two, three?
Audience: (Children sing) (Laughter) (Children singing) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) So let me ask you, open your eyes. We make it all the time.
"Everybody who's got there." "If the noise comes? (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) So what's the point of this all? The question is what's going to do for us science."
We usually go through the life responding to the situation, but if we want to do something differently, we have to jump in touch, and when open your eyes opened, he sees the world in a new way.
That's what science offers us. They're going to give us the opportunity to do with the heavens.
I think that the right science should give people space on your own opinion and allow them to express the view, because I've connected the Ama to end this talk.
Ah?
OK, this project was really very exciting for me, because I was living a process of discovery, and showed me that everybody, and I think everybody, has a potential to discover something new, and that a little question can lead to big discoveries.
They change the way someone thinks about something, it can be a simple or hard process, and it depends on how the person is evolving in.
But to change the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy, and we started playing the game, and then we started thinking about the puzzle, and then I realized that science is not just boring subject, and that everybody can discover something new.
You need a opportunity, and this is my friend of Beau and the project of Blacktown.
Thank you. BL: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
It's 1800.
It's called an extraordinary invention.
It's called the microscope.
There's a tiny form of life that I don't see with the naked eye.
They're usually finding that many of them are more vulnerable human diseases.
Imagine what was happening in the company when you realized that the English women didn't touch the tea, but they were full of a monster, and the imagery is from London, nearly here.
200 years later.
He's still going to be here, it's still going to fall in developing countries in the tropical bandwidth.
It's just a small million deaths a year, and over billions of people are threatened by different species, and it needs to go through tests.
To tell those holes, it's not such as difficult.
You take colors, arroathaneine or a stainless color or a Cammer and microscope and you observe.
Everybody has a face.
Why do Gox from Kenya, Fatima from Bangladesh and Julio from Mumbai and Julie and Mary waiting for months to figure out what's the disease?
It's because he's never going to be enough bird's stupid diagnostic devices.
Remember that number: a billion.
The problem is in the microscope.
He disrupted the modern science, a microscope, because he doesn't get access to the field.
It was originally not occurred to diagnosis.
It's difficult, big, hard to maintain and is expensive.
Two colleagues of my students, Jim and James included India and Thailand and they were thinking about this problem.
We've seen the very gifted devices.
In some lenss, mushrooms have been mushroomed.
And some people didn't even know their functional microscope.
The result of this effort and the road was an idea that we called the Flodscoscope.
What is going on?
The Philippine is a completely functional microscope with the opportunity of phlusis, the lighting field, the missions, the projections, all advanced functions and pieces hotly out of paper.
You probably wonder how this is possible.
I'm going to show you some examples, and we're going to go.
It starts with one letter of paper.
They're all kinds of pieces on defeating the process of functional fluorescent microscopes.
It's three parts: Opsium, light and Clon.
Down here's a micro-opacy that's hidden directly into paper.
There's no clue in any language on paper.
There's a colored code on it that you know how to fold the thin microscope.
The score looks like this, and it's got all the function of normal microscope, like a cross line where you see patterns, that's here.
This is new, but all the classical colors remain a lot of different diseases.
You put a sample in sales.
What's on this point is good and the students don't hate when I do it, but I do it so, it's her resistance.
I can turn it down, throw away ground and see it.
Even though, even though it's made of such a flexible materials like paper.
It's also ironic that this is normally known as a standard diagnostic device, but in this envelope, I have 30 different flups on different purposes, all in one packaging.
I'll take one of them.
This is what we proposed specifically in malaria because they're in zoo filters to diagnos malaria.
That's why we have special microscopes to individual diseases.
You haven't yet seen what you can see in this microscope.
I'd like to show you something if we can moulble lights, please. We can also teach the philanthropy.
I'm going to switch these two microscopes, and I'm going to show you exactly what you would see in the microscope.
You're looking at... (Applause) This is a land cutaway and when I zoom in.
And you can see how the lenses are connected in the spinal cord.
Now, you can see my favorite insect that I like to hate. You see the tip of the mosquito beer.
I'm here.
It's a facility I just described.
You see, they're going to be slipper and thrilled.
Are we going to be fighting?
Now I'm going to tell you now, because it's time we're running out of time, and we're reclaiming the production of mycelium, so we're only going to spend 50 cents in translation.
(Applause) Which is why we can think about a new paradigm in the microscope, we call it "" energy and off. "
You see a letter "
And as we thought about new ideas.
They've got the size of A44.
Here's the three parts I've mentioned.
The silk components are up here in the right, we needed to figure out how to make scales embedded into a high production capacity, and we use the process of self-assembly and surface tensions on the papers directly in paper.
I'm going to go through lenses.
Here's the source of light.
Finally, all parts are fundamentally embedded into themselves as origami, because this origami allows us to micro-controlled optical statements.
The other thing we did, of course, is that our microscope is resilient, it's up to 3. whips and throw it down.
Here's a survivor.
Our next goal is to finish the landscape test.
We're beginning to start the end of the summer.
We make thousands of microscopes.
We started harvesting the data of malaria, Chagas's disease and the gyardoros from the patients.
I'll leave that with this image.
Now, before I didn't realize that, but there's an interesting link between conventional education and the world health.
What kinds of tools do we own? The babies who are going to fight fairly creepy in the future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, it's 1995, I graduated at high school, and we're going to go to the Procody of Provas Island to Portland.
You know, we're young and unemployed, so we're going to decide to solve the whole thing on the barnal routes through national parks, protected forests — short, we chose the longest path as well.
Well, somewhere in the middle of South Dakoty turned to my friend and asking her question I think about 2,000 miles.
"" "What's the Chinese character I still see in the travels?" "
My friend looked at me with a completely blank way.
Actually, a man in front of the front row shows her expression.
"(Laughter) And I'm going to explain her," "You know, all those brands that we see with the Chinese sign." "And she's still looking at me, and then it's going to go because he knows what I'm talking about."
And what I'm talking about is this.
(Laughter) Yes, the famous Chinese sign for the carrot zone. (Laughter)
Over the past five years, I've been interested in thinking about the situation just like this — why sometimes we don't understand the signs around us as we behave, and what all of us can tell us about human nature.
In other words, as you heard Chris, for the last five years, I was interested in thinking about how I was wrong.
This may seem like a special choice of employment, but it actually has one big advantage: there's no health competition.
(Laughter) The truth is that a lot of us do everything that they can go to the mistake, or at least the idea that there's a possibility that we're wrong.
As an abstract concept, we all understand that.
We all know that everybody in this room does mistakes.
Humanity generally is error — okay, okay.
But when it comes to me, everything I believe in, now in the present time, suddenly this abstract notion of error is flowing out of the window — and I don't really know what I'm wrong with.
And the thing is that time is the one that we live in.
We're going to go on meeting meetings at the present time, we're going to go to family vacations at the present time, vote in the present time.
So in fact, we all fly a life flight in the trapping of this little bubble feeling that in everything we have right.
I think this is a problem.
I think it's a problem for everyone as an individual in our private and profession lives, and I think it's also a collective problem as a culture.
So what I want to do today is the first, to talk why we're stuck inside this feeling.
And second, why this is a problem.
And I want to convince you that it's possible, to interfere from this sense, and if you can, it's just a big moral, intellectual and creative jump, what you can do.
So why are we going to hide in that feeling right?
Well, one reason is that we're wrong.
"I want to ask you something, or actually, I want to ask something, because you are straight here: What's that feeling —" "emotion —" "— what's the feeling when you're wrong?"
He's endangered, falling down.
He embarrasss. Okay, heada, very good.
A performer, falling down, gloves — religion, these are great answers, but they're answers to another question.
You answer your question: What's the point of realization that we're wrong?
(Laughter) (Laughter) The realization that you're wrong is like something and a lot of other things, right?
This may be daunting, it can be as a discovery, and it can be funny, like my hip, with a Chinese character.
But just squeaky isn't feeling.
I'll give you an anagram.
Do you remember the Lord's tours of Paris? Where, the one that's still trying to do, but never leave the taps?
Almost in every episode, this cartoon is a moment where a horse fills the tap and knocks out of a cliff that's okay — it's a bird, it can fly.
But the thing is that the horse goes out of a cliff right now.
And what's fun — at least if you're six years old — it's quite okay.
The direction continued to — until the moment he looks down and realizes it's only in air without ground in the window.
And then he'd stopped.
When we're wrong with something — not when we recognize that we're wrong, but before we're the nerds, what's going to attract out of the cliff and before they go down.
You know, we're wrong, we've already got a problem already, but we still feel that we have a landway ground.
So I would actually fix what I said a while ago.
It's a feeling. It feels like having right.
(Laughter) So this is one reason, structured reason, why do we feel in the feeling of care.
I call it the blind line.
Most of the time, we don't have a lot of internal impulses that might say we're wrong until it's too late.
But there's also a second reason we feel in this sense, and this is cultural.
They're launched in elementary school.
You're sitting in a classroom, your teacher's going to give you the results from writing, and one of them looks like this.
It's not my, by the way.
(Laughter) So you're here at a base school, and you know exactly what you think of the kids who received this paper.
It's a stupid kid, the one that makes problems, the one that never dreams the homework.
So in the time you've learned nine years old, you've learned they've learned that they're going to take errors and undoodnouncers — and in the second, the road, as in life, is never going to do no mistakes.
These really bad lessons learn really well.
And a lot of us — and I think most of us here in this room — that they're going to make sure that they become perfect units, high-resistant, far nutritional individuals.
Is it like that, Mr. CFO, the ultra-mathonon?
(Laughter) So as it turns out, you're all CFO, the alphys, ultramaterialists.
Okay, okay.
Once we all go to the possibility that we've done something wrong.
Because he thinks something wrong, it means that something is wrong with us.
So we're just insisting that we're right, because it makes sense that we are clever and responsible and safety.
So let me tell you a story.
A few years ago, a woman came to Beat Sandconsin's Hospital for the surgical operation for the surgical operation.
Beat Isaill is in Boston.
It's a hospital where students go from Harvard, one of the best hospitals in the country.
So this woman comes and picks it into the old desert.
It gets an analogy, the surgeon will do his robot — it's going back and send it back and sends it to room.
Everything looks okay.
"It's going to wake up and look down at it and say," "Why is there another side of my body?" "Now, the bad side of her body is in the prisoners, because the surgeon's surgery at her left foot, the seat of her right leg."
When the visibility of health care in Beat State talked about this intuition said something very interesting.
"He said," "Whatever reason, the surgeon just thought he was on the right side of the patient." "(Laughter) The punch of this story is that too much confidence in the sense that we're on the right side of something that might be very dangerous."
This internal feeling of the news that we all experience so often is not the trusted guide of what's really going on in the outside world.
And when we act that it is, and we stop the possibility that we can be wrong, so that's the moment where we start to do things like water waste 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, or showing the world economy.
So it's a bigly practical problem.
But it's also a big social problem.
Think about what it means to feel we have truth.
What this means is you think your belief is just perfectly matched reality.
And if you do that, you have to solve one problem that is, how do you explain all those mosques that don't agree with you?
It turns out that most of us illuminate the same way that they turned into a series of undifferent predictions.
The first thing we usually do when someone doesn't agree with us is that it's a guarantee.
It doesn't have access to the same information that we have, and so if we're generosity, we're going to see the light and they're attached to our team.
Once it doesn't work, and it's going to be that these people have exactly the same facts as we do, and they don't agree with us, so let's move to the other assumption that they are idiots.
(Laughter) They have all the right pieces of the puzzle, and they're too keen to get them right together.
And if this doesn't bother that people who don't agree with us, they don't agree with us exactly the same facts like us, and they're actually really smart, so we're going to move to the third premise: They know the truth, and they're challenging it for their own causy modes.
This is a disaster.
This puncting towards actually prevents us from errors when we need absolutely need it and causing ourselves to behave together.
But what's most mysterious to me is the most tragic thing about this is that it comes to the whole sense of being human.
It's like we'd like to suggest that our minds are just perfectly clear windows, and we just look out and we're looking for the rest of the world.
We want everyone looking at this same window, and see this same thing.
That's not true, and if that's true, life would be incredibly boring.
The correlation in your mind is not that you can see the world as it is.
But you can see him the one that's not.
We know the past, and we can think about the future, and we can imagine what this is to be a different person in a different place.
And we all do this a little bit differently, which is why we all can look up at the same night sky and see this, and this is also this, and this is also happening.
And actually, it's also a reason why we're wrong.
"Two years ago, Descarts said his grade thing about" "I think." "This one, I am." "This person, September and wrote the" "Frankrr Sack" "—" I loved, "" I said. ""
And it suggests that our ability to infect something is not a kind of neglected tower in the human system, something we can exploit or break it down.
It's a cute basic thing we are.
Because contrary from God, we don't really know what's out there.
And contrary from other animals, we're obsessed with experiments.
To me, this obsession is the source and the root of all of our products and creativity.
"And a big year, for various reasons, I learned a lot of Ethiopian showing" "The American life." "
So listen and hearing, and at some point, I'm going to make sure all of these stories are about how we're wrong.
"And my first idea was," "I won it."
I became a crazy lady.
"I've accomplished it everywhere," "and it happened."
But a few months later, I received a chance to do an interview with the Irio Gilass, which sails this show.
"And I asked him this thing." "And he answered me," "No, that's true."
"In fact, they say," "We're sorry that every single episode of this shows me the same hidden darkness."
"And this hidden notion is," "I thought it's going to become this thing, and the place has become something else." "And the thing is," "Here" "I Love Gills," "because this is what we need."
"We need these moments of surprise and nuance and wrongness, so that these stories worked." "And for the rest of us — members of the audience, Friends, Friends, we're making these things."
We like things like taste rescues, false stamps, and surprising actions.
When it comes to our stories, we like when we're wrong.
But you know, our stories are this, because our lives are like this.
We think it's one thing, and it becomes something else.
George Bush thought that when he strikes a lot of coal destroys, he frees people and delivers democracy to the middle east.
And there's something else that happened.
And Holly Muubatt thought that he was going to be a pioneer in Egypt all his life until it's too old or too sick, and then the government took the government to his son.
And there's something else that happened.
And you may have thought you're growing up, you're going to have a wedding with your inner school, and you walk back to the hometown and you're going to get depressed.
And there's something else that happened.
And I have to tell you that I thought I'm going to write a good book about things that everybody's ever going to do, for the audience that they're never going to get rid of.
And there's something else that happened.
(Laughter) I want to say, this is life.
For good, we generate these wonderful stories about the world around us, and then the world turns out and wonders us.
No harm, but this conference is an incredible motivation for our ability to do things badly.
We've spent a whole week talking about innovation and improvement, but do you know why we need all of these innovations and progress and enhanced?
Because half of the things that are most motivation and the world's delightful — TEDF — and they're flying.
(Laughter) Very good, not? (Laughter)
Where's my Jefferson Chris? (Laughter)
(Applause) So again, we're coming back.
And so it goes on.
We're going to come with another idea.
Let's talk another story.
Let's do another conference.
Now, this particular thing you've heard today is 70 million — times it's a retouching wonder.
"And for me, if you really want to decipherated wonder, you need to step out of that tiny, embedded space of status and look around and look around and look around and look at the clarity and complexity of this universe and be able to say," "Wow, I don't know."
"Maybe I'm wrong." "Thank you."
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
The provisions involve what we do, and how do we deal with.
The questions that are important for me is who and why.
I want to know the people I choose for food.
I want to know how I influence them.
I want to know how they affect me.
I want to know why they go to the fish.
I want to know how they rely on generosity when they want to earn.
So, gathering these things allow us to stop seeing the gifts of the sea as good and started to view them as an opportunity to rebuild our ecosystem.
It allows us to celebrate that gift of the sea that we can afford to eat.
So how do we call it?
It's the process of the sea.
Leadership means the ability to prevent and maintain, and that's the ability to take over and grow.
This food allows to develop and dynamic justice, and it brings our relationship to the ocean as a resource, suggest that we're trying to reinvent oceans, and about encouraging their resistance.
It's more hopeful, human and useful way to understand our environment.
So the Vreck facilities — common thing in many seamounts — it's a useful and a sensation tool.
Green, yellow and red lists of sea species.
It's very easy: buy green, don't buy red, yellow powers.
But I think it's not really good enough to eat the green ones.
It's not sustainable until the menstrual success is not going to be a change in the yellow and the red list.
And what if we're only looking at a green list?
Here's the tuna yellow-plexed, chimed on the street — of a sustainable population.
Folded out — no pavement of the lils.
It's great for fish. This is profit. It's the local economy.
But it's a lenny. It's a finished predator.
What's in the background of this food?
Should you sit down at 4,400 powers of this food?
Three times in a week?
It can still be on a vegetable list, but I don't even do the kind of person or not even the ocean.
The bottom line is we need to see the importance of our sculptures.
One: I've heard that red wine is wonderful for my health — anti-finady and minerals — the heart is going to be healthy.
Cool! I love red wine!
I'm going to give you a lot. I'm going to be healthy.
But after the grass bottles, you tell me that I have a problem?
Well, our friends, we have a problem with proteins.
We've lost a sensitivity when it's about food, and let's pay attention to it.
The problem is that the costs are hiding under the waves.
We hide our costs for social confidence in the tape.
And we hide the costs for massive profits.
First, food from the cost of the sea really takes to account for our needs.
"You go," "Fapper or fish" "by the company Gorton's Nrton" "" They don't stop the stability of the sea, it's rather Joseph Green Gilant Fantastic. "
Green War: He could save the oceans.
Sylvia's radio saying that blue is new green.
And I'm talking to the respect that some vegetables could be the new blue.
We have to continue to eat the best of the sea if it's possible.
But we have to eat these kinds of vegetables.
He's best at the cost of the sea, they're constructed on it and with the pagbaste, and with the knees of the texture.
"It's gotten 1403 simulated silently in the Samdored fever and a smell of" "witnessful odor brass," "and with hipcorn, a smellful of bramy, a Greek armor, soot and a passage, and a passage on the surface, just with your legs."
June!
That's where it's selling itself.
The best part about it is that each family has all the ingredients to reach in the local self-term.
Jama Academy is leading campaign to save people before they're eating.
They're leading a campaign to save the oceans before our own diet.
Here's a similarity here.
Forget about the nuclear Holocaust; we have to worry about visions.
We've targeted our planet, and then we've been spending food so that we're more screwed.
So I think our eating is bad.
I think it's time for us to change our expectations from food.
Usualness is complicated, but it's a thing that we all understand very well.
So let's begin here.
That's what's happening in its own ecologically possible food.
Dan Barber and Alice Walter committed a revolution for ecological and poor food.
We often eat ourselves as consumers lead to harm accountability.
And just because something comes out of the current source doesn't mean we can behave to that.
We have ecological surpluses.
We have technology to their ecological production.
But we will never have limitless environmental generators with shrimp.
It wouldn't work.
The food available for the heart is a critical part of the harshness of the sea.
Whereas we try to rebuild the declining Mermaid, media recommends the higher energy consumption of the sea.
The study says that tens of thousands of Americans have older, old fathers, ages and fathers could join other born if they'd eat more crops.
I'm not willing to give up to this struggle.
But it's not just about the crops of the sea.
It's a way we look at the plate.
So as a Swedish, I found out that the most easier will be whenever they change the pupil on the plate.
There have been several things.
I made more money.
Humans started buying preducts and lettuces, because they knew that the main hallways wouldn't be counted.
They spent more time over their food, spend more time together.
In short, they've got more than what they've done in, even if they get less protein.
They got more calories from multiple levels.
It was successful by their health. I'm more fit.
That's delicious.
At every dish, autism has been presumed to the environment, but also the very nature of independence to the interests of themselves.
The other thing we've done: we're peering more diverse species — a lot of lawyers, rap failures, cheese.
Criefs, tears, lots of food flys, slubbtens — these very commons.
We've been brought to the harder, better choices.
This is what we need to support.
This recommends the green list.
And it's also a possible start to recover our environment.
But what about those big predators, with those elegant species, with that of a green list that I've been talking about?
If it's vital, I have a recipe.
It works for any big kind of fish in the ocean, so here's it.
Start with a 45-50 version of pond.
Take the knife. You cut it down to four pieces.
Give them four plates.
You load these plates piles of vegetables and Open your best burgeragon, what you have, lock your fame, and you break it out.
Show the opportunity you can eat it.
You know the friends and neighbors and sums of it for a year, at least.
I expect a lot from food from food.
I expect health and joy and family, and society.
What I expect is that the act of leadership, preparing and consumption is a part of the human interests.
I was lucky that my father was a fantastic gun.
He gave me a moment about the privilege that consumes food is.
OK, I remember myself from my childhood.
They were the sensible porc stained with a lot of vegetables and a little tiny trap, usually with rice.
That's what I usually eat today.
I'm going to be wrong when I'm going to visit you.
I'm going to talk about it.
It's like a monkey from protein.
It's disgusting.
But from all the horrible news you're hearing and you're going to hear about the state of the oceans, and unfortunately I have to talk to you is the worst one that your mother is right.
You eat vegetables.
It's very easy.
So what's going on in food?
I'm looking for healthy ingredients that are held for my body.
He's been joyful for joy and my sister and sexuality things, so that food was not impressed as a punishment.
I'm going to seek recipes that incorporate my personal story.
But for a society, we're going to start at the very beginning.
It doesn't interfere with the fact that everything we eat has a worldwide consequence.
The bottom lines figure out what the consequences are, and then you do the first step to minimize their minimize.
We've seen a picture of our blue planet, our global banks.
But it's more than just utility; it's a worldwide geogography of the community we call nine.
So if we take the rest of the rest, we can start to accelerate, we can start celebrating, we can start to scroll.
We have to clear vegetables.
We've got to save smaller levels of the sea.
We have to save lunch.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In 1986, much earlier than people started talking about ecological issues and the environment, I started testing paper-making furniture.
Testos on new structural materials are very complicated. This was much more difficult than I was waiting, and since it's an industrial material, we can also encode it as much exploitation.
In the year 2000, in Germany, there was plenty in Germany.
I built a palplined on paperwork, recyclable paper.
The goal is not building the building.
That was the goal of my proposal.
They're invisible.
They're challenging us to organize their power and money by creating the mobility of architecture.
So I started working in coffee areas.
In 1994, there was a big conflict in Africa.
They were Bob's opposed to two kilometers, Huton and Turkey.
More than two million people have become refugees.
What led to massive deforestation and the ecological issue.
Therefore they started secreting aluminum ladders.
"And he said," "My God! You'd go ahead? (Applause)"
They were living under the plastic debris in the park.
I suggested them.
In 2001, I also built a growth ticket in West India.
I asked me to confront a provión chick.
They're still used, even after the last earthquake in China.
In 2009, the earthquake had earthquakes in Italian L'Aqua.
I proposed a older idea that I would build a prosody arithmetic.
After the earthquake and tsunami, people had to be evacuating in big rooms like the body.
But it was really necessary.
Now I'm working on New Zealand in Christchurch.
Thank you very much.
What's going on in this childhood mind?
If you asked people for 30 years ago, most people, including psychologists, would say that this baby is irrational, neutral, egocentric, self-controlled, that you can't accept another person or understand the causality.
In the last 20 years, development has been completely rejected by this idea.
So, in some ways, we think that the thinking of this child is as the best scientists.
Let me give you an example.
One thing that this kid could think about what would happen in his mind is to try to find what's going on in the minds of another child.
After all, one of the things that's the most difficult for all of us is to figure out what they think and they feel other people.
And perhaps the hardest thing about all is to figure out what other people think and feeling, isn't exactly what we think and feel ourselves.
Anyone who's watching politics can determine how difficult it is for some people to understand this.
We wanted to know if babies and small children could understand this serious thing about other people.
So the question is: How would we ask them?
The kids can't talk, and when you ask three-year-olds to tell you what they think, you get a beautiful bird of the stream of consciousness and born and things like that.
So how do you actually ask the question?
Well it turns out that the secret was in the pins.
The Beats Rachellili, one of my students, and I — we gave children two names with food: one mask with a raw broclic and one of the lower nurses.
All the kids don't even like refugees, they like sperm and they don't like raw broccoli.
(Laughter) But then, what Beck did was she was suffering food from each supplement.
And they were faced as though they were sick or not.
Half of the time behaved like he had a basementful, and she doesn't like a broclic — just like a small child and every other normal person.
"But half of the time, she took a piece of pinplin, and she said," "Yum, broccoli."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry." "And then she took a little bit of cheese and said," "Oh, folk, brink."
"I'm sorry. Blee, relax." "So he behaved, as if what she wanted was the exact opposite of what children wanted to do."
This is 15 and 18 year-old children.
"Then the arms lay down and said," "Do you give me a couple?" "
So the question is: What's her kid who's been sick or grinding it?
And it was remarkable, in fact, that 18 months old children barely barely traveling and saying, they gave her seasons, but they gave her a shot, but they gave her the broccoli, they gave her the broccoli.
On the other hand, 15 months old when they looked at her, when they were faced that he would like a broccoli, as if they couldn't understand it.
But then what they looked at that long time, they just gave her the older, the ones that thought they had to respect everything.
Perhaps there's two really remarkable things.
The first one is that these little 18-month-old children have learned this serious reality about human nature that we don't always want the same.
More fascinating, they actually felt that they were actually supposed to help other people get what they want.
But even more remarkable is that 15 years old kids don't do that, what suggests that 18-month-old children have learned this deep reality of human nature in three months since they did 15 months.
So kids know more and learn more than we might think.
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies in the last 20 years, that proves it.
The question you might ask is: Why do kids learn so much?
And how is it possible that they're going to learn in a short time?
After all, when you look at the children's surface, it's no longer any of them.
And in many ways, it's worse, because we're spending so much time and energy only to survive.
But if you look at how evolution lies on the mystery, why do we spend as much time as possible, it turns out that there's actually an answer.
If we look at a lot and many different types of animals, not only in primates, but also other mammals, birds, even further pollution, even in Arabic, appears that there's a relationship between those long childhood species, and how big their brains are compared to bricks, and what they're smart and flexible.
The bubbles of this idea are birds on the screen.
On one side, a modern-day crowned injury.
Color and other corn bird, tarrans, and so forth, they're incredibly smart birds.
They're in certain directions like a chimpanzee.
And this is a bird at the cover of Science that learned to use a tool to get food.
On the other hand here, we have our grade, the sleepy of households.
And chickens, ducks, hips and strokes are simply dumb.
So they're very, very good at the scenes, and they aren't very good at anything else.
It turns out that juveniles of modern-day murderers are staying in nesting until operations.
They're addicted to their mothers, and they're going to abandon them worms to their little open scenes until two years, which is really long in the life of a bird.
They're contributing to a few months.
So childhood is why they end up kissing on the envelope and the rubbrs in the barrels of the soup.
The almother childhood seems to be connected to knowledge and learning.
So what's the explanation for this?
Some animals, like fossils, seem to be nicely equipped on the cost of the only thing.
So they seem to be gorgeously equipped in one environment.
The other creatures like wine are not actually very good at anything, but they're extremely well in learning about the laws of the laws.
Now, of course, human beings, we're all kinds of jams.
We have a much bigger brains compared to a tattoo than a musical species.
We're smarter, more adapted, we know more to learn, we're going to survive in more diverse environments, we have covered the whole world and they've gotten into space.
And our children are dependent on us much longer than children's children.
My son is 23 years old.
(Laughter) In mind, while they don't have 23, we still keep putting tubes into those little open mouths.
So why would we see here?
It's theory that this strategy is extremely powerful, powerful strategy than in the world to sell, but has one big downside.
The disadvantage is, until you just learn, you're going to be helpless.
"So if you think about marijuana, you don't want to think," Father or maybe they could stop. "" But what better? ""
That all you really want to know before they're manipulating anymore.
The way that evolution solved this problem is exactly the kind of special distribution of work.
According to this theory, we have a wound in time where we're completely protected.
We don't have to do anything. It's just to learn.
Then, in adulthood, we can take everything we learned as kids and do it in real world.
One way to look at it is that children are like a department of research and development of human race.
They're protected by drowns whose task is to go out and learn and have good ideas, and we're constructed and marketing.
We have to have all the ideas we've learned when we're children, to exploit.
Another way, as you can look at it, it's not as kids in the uncertain adults, and we should take them as an intentional advanced phase of that same species — something like history and butterflies — with the difference that they're these fantastic butterflies that fly around the garden and explore, and we're a blissum that slowly reflects the footprint to adults.
If babies are designed to learning — and this evolutionary story suggests that they are, that's what they are, they're predicted — they're expected to have a really powerful mechanism for learning.
And indeed, the brain's mind seems to be the most powerful computer to learning on this planet.
Even though the actual computer slows it slowly.
Recently in our understanding of machines, machines has become a revolution.
It's built on the idea of this man, Reverage Thomasas, statistics and math from the 18th century.
Banks gave a mathematical way to use the theory of relevance to characterize, the description of the scientists that scientists have known the world.
The scientists are doing the idea that they have a hypothesis that they want to start.
They're going to take it and test it on evidence.
The evidence of explanations get to change the hypothetical.
Then they test new ideas and so forth.
Banks showed us a mathematical way to do it.
This mathematics is the core of the best programs for the teaching machines we have today.
About 10 years ago, I came up with the theory that babies do exactly the same thing.
So if you want to know what's going on in these beautiful brown eyes, I think it looks like this.
This is a Brain Reverte Baysas.
So I think babies actually make complicated calculations with the conditions that they promote in order to figure out how the world works.
It seems to be a little bit more excited.
Because when you're going to tell the statistics, you're looking at an extremely silly.
How could it be possible to the statistics to do children?
In order to test them, we used a machine that we called the Blackite Delta Web.
It's a puzzle that shines and plays music when you put the right objects on it.
So using this very easy machine, myself and other lab watching studies that show how good babies are learning in the world.
I just remember one that we did with the Tom Krurapura, my students.
If I showed you this detector, you would like to think that you're going to put your cube on it.
In fact, this detector works a little strange.
Because if you give your cube over the detector, what you're never going to do in the first scenario is the detectors activated at two of three trials.
And if you do that, you put your cube on a detector, they're only going to be only two of six threads.
So the neocortex is actually more powerful evidence.
It seems to be much more effective than a second strategy.
This is what we did; we gave four year-old kids to prove this pattern and ask them to stop it.
And indeed, these four-year-olds have used proof, and they have objects over the detector.
And two things are really interesting about this.
First, remember that this is a four-year-old kid.
They're just learning how to count.
But they don't do complicated calculations that determine their value according to them.
The second interesting thing is that they're using this evidence to create ideas, the idea of the world that seems very unlikely.
The kinds of studies we did in my lab showed that four-year-old kids were going to come upon the irreducible hypotheses before the adults would get the same puzzle.
So, in these circumstances, children are using statistics to know the world, but because scientists do experiments, we wanted to see if the kids do experiments.
When kids experimented, we're saying they're trying to do everything possible, or they've been published, and recently, they were published with multiple studies that showed that the playing is actually the exact kind of experimental research program.
Here's one of the lab Crio Legare.
The drug used our Black Deuter.
She showed kids that yellow lights were activated and red, and then showed them an anomaly.
Now you'll see, like this little boy passed five hypotheses over two minutes.
(Video) Boy: And what?
The same thing as a second side.
Alison Goapnik: Okay, his first hypothesis was just proportioned.
(Laughter) Boy: This pirated and this is nothing.
AG: OK, downloaded your notebook to experiments.
Boy: Is it serve?
(Laughter) I don't know.
AG: Every scientist recognizes this expression of desperation.
(Laughter) Boy: Ah, because this has to be this way, and this is what's going on.
AG: Okay, a hypothesis number two.
Boy: That's why.
Whoa.
(Laughter) AG: This is his next idea.
He told the experiment to do this to try to interview other places.
It doesn't work.
Boy: Ah, because the light goes from here, no longer.
Ah, the bottom of this box has electricity, and this is not electricity.
AG: Okay, that's the fourth hypothesis.
Boy: negotiates.
So when we're going to give you four.
Four here is lighting, and two dozens, so that goes around.
AG: Okay, that's his Friday hypothesis.
This is particularly nice and balanced guy, but what Crione discovered is that this is pretty staggering.
When you watch children at the grave, if you ask them to explain something, what they do is a series of experiments.
At four-year-olds, it's pretty common.
Well, what's being like this slide?
What's the point of one of those fabulous things that religion can test five hypotheses for two minutes?
If we go back to the psychologists and philosophers, many of them said that babies and children perceive very little if something is.
I think the opposite is true.
I think babies and children perceive more than adults.
It's about the context of the adult person, we know this.
Because theness and the conscious adult looks a little bit like a light flow.
In adults, when they decide that something is relevant or important, pay attention.
Our understanding of things that we do is become extremely clear and alive, and everything else is going to fit into darkness.
We even knew something about how the brain does it.
When we give birth, the weapon of the facade lobe, the powerful part of our brain, sends a signal that a little part of our brain makes a lot of adapted, self-esteem, improved in the rest of the brain.
So there's a very focused thing, a goal of awareness.
When we look at babies and small children, we see something quite different.
I think babies and small children have more and more likely to be friends than the battery of perceive.
So they're very bad at focusing only one thing.
But they're very good at earning lots of information from many different sources at once.
If you look at their brain, you'll see that they're flooded with neurotransmitters and faces, and the boundless portion doesn't even abandon.
So when we say babies and small kids don't know, they don't really think we can't pay attention.
They don't like to get rid of all the interesting things that they might say, and to watch what's important.
This kind of attention, consciousness, we would expect from the transcripts that are designed to education.
If we'd like adults want to touch the child, I think the best is to imagine the new situation we'd never been before — when we love to love someone new, or when we first in a new city.
And our consciousness doesn't stop, but it expands, so those three days in Paris seemed to be full of perception and the experience as moons where we're going to travel, talks and bonding tastes.
And by the way, that curves, the great bone you drink down, mimic the effect of child neurospressors.
So what's the child?
It's like being in love, the first time in Paris, and after three-dimensional dramas.
(Laughter) It's a great state, but tell you that the third morning you're going to wake up with crying. (Laughter)
It's good to be adults.
I don't want too much to talk about how wonderful babies are.
It's good to be adults.
We can tie ourselves over the street and go through the street.
And it's correct that we're spending lots of effort to think of kids as we do.
But if we want to be mootile, having an open mind, learnness, creativity, politics at least sometimes, we should start thinking more than children.
(Applause)
I'm going to tell you a story about how I became a Malay dog to HIV / AIDS.
This is my campaign, SING.
4664 is a number Mandela as a prisoner on RobAn Island.
That's me and Yosss N.
They invited all of artist artists to go to the Robdel Island, where the press had a graphic conference for journalists from the entire world before their own community.
You can see in the eye.
And for all of us, it was a significant moment for us.
"That's when Mandela said the world" "The emerging genocide," "that his country's infants are dying to the faller of the apocalypty." "" "The poor nation" "every day, and that the main victims, the most creative, are women and children."
I very touched me because I was married and my mother, and until I realized that the virgins had consumed the woman's HIV-AIDS.
"I have to serve that." "So I was a reason from then embarking on each other" "46666," "if it was possible, and I was following the printed fiction conferences, interviews, lectures, and used their names of singers, like I promise Mandela, and the respects to his enormous suit that he performed."
Nelson Mandela's respect is the whole world.
I recognized him on the front of 4864.
He had the shirt that I have now on myself.
It's a tool. I'm telling you that I'm dealing with people who have HIV, with people who live with HIV.
"And because that's a stigma, this trick, I say," "Yes, we can talk about it."
"It doesn't have to be a secret." "I became a member of Trect Prompondern, and I felt that I was a member of this amazing organization."
It's a campaign in the lowest level and 80 percent of the members that most of which is HIV-positive.
They're working in the ground.
They have education programs.
They're contagious to the problems of this subject.
Their work is remarkable.
This is my company SING.
And the SING generally communicates me and about three or four people who help me.
In the last two and a half years, I crossed the whole world. I was about 12 different countries.
Here I'm in the Phoenix Oss and I'm going to pause a nice, fat momentum. Here I'm singing in Hongcongo, and I'm trying to get money.
This is a Scottish Parliament.
And this is in the Ranburgh, with a great African child who loves.
Many kids like this axis, because their family have encoded their virus.
I'm making it easier and expanding my own.
The message that this program today is broadcast now to the world, is: in 2015, we want to witness the full end of transmission from the mother to the child.
It's a very ambitious goal, but I believe that with politics, it's proven.
I'm here with a pregnant woman that's a HIV-positive, and we're born because we have abundant confidence, because we know that this young woman learns longer and she could take care of a child that punishs.
It's prevented by the very beginning of life.
It's one of the way they fight against virgins.
I'd like to end with a brief story about Alvelo.
Here's Aimee. I'm going to hold with me everywhere.
I'm telling the story of telling everybody because you're falling one of the millions of the nutritional / AIDS.
Mother Around had a virus. It flew over the sickness of AIDS.
There's tides had Alomalole. He was born with him.
Here's six years old, and he doesn't even experience more than a year of a child.
At that time, she suffered in advanced medication and had pneumonia.
We knew her in the hospital in Eloan Cajan, and they spent the entire afternoon, the gold.
They were married and the nurses were great.
They gave her a very strange nutritional diet, and they were great about it.
So five months later, we'd returned to the South Africa to come back to Alice again.
And this changed into this change.
I'm going to conclude that you appreciate that change.
So I'd like to tell you, and every one of you, if you think that every mother and every child in the world have right to good diet and good health care, and if you believe that development goals in the United Nations, especially the goals of the F.N. budget, they have to decide all the governments around the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, please, stop.
(Applause)
Fifty years ago in the Soviet Union, the engineers of the secretly regulated a big object through an abandoned landscape.
They were hoping at the negotiating people around the world by becoming the first ones that the universe conquers.
Shakey was enormous.
And her handmadely covered the silver bullet with two crabs indoors inside.
4. Octoon 1977 was their breakthrough.
"One of the Russian scientists said," "We're going to create a new planet that we call Sputnik."
In ancient houses, discoveries like Vivico's Huma and Colombia have big luck in exploring the Earth.
Now, we have the fortune to discover the universe.
"They're going to be going to be our joy in the future." "You're watching the strings from" "Sputnik," "my five-year-old movie, which is almost finished."
She's telling the story of Sputnik and the story of what's happened with Aimee.
Over a few days afterwards, the Sputnik is an amazing interesting thing.
The moon has seen a month to ordinary people's normal and pride out that you can finally release the object in space.
But for three days later, in a day called the Red Poor, the media and the politicians said, and we believed that Sputnik was evidence that our enemy was brought us in science and technology, and that now they could be attacked by hydrogen bombs, using the rockets Sputnik, like an intervention.
There's a lot of hell.
The nurser became one of the three shocks of events for America — the historians were squatted to Plu Harrbrani or 9 / 11.
"It's called" "smash" "wetsuit."
They hatched the race in arms.
They started with the space race.
Throughout the year scale, the vast increase of deforestation came down and went from 12,000 nuclear weapons to 2030.
The reactor at Sputnik has just been to increase the number of the decline.
For example, some of the boards will remember this day, the June 1988, the national exercise civilian wounds, when tens of millions of people in 78 cities have gone to the floor.
Or a study of public names that he found that 7 out of 10 Americans believed that 70 Americans believed that the eradication of the military and that at least 50 percent of the population is declining.
But Sputnik has exploded a great change.
For example, some people in this room had a scholarship on the height of Sputnik.
The traditional techniques, math and science — educated as such — rapidly grew up.
And Van Crugge shows that Sputnik has led directly to the ARPA and the Internet and of course.
My document showed as a single society can be solved by those who know how to use media.
But also, it represents how we can change what's going to look like, in something that eventually has been very good for America.
"" "Sputnik" "is going to be pretty staggering."
What I'd like to do is to take a moment to TED from my investors: the long TEDster, Jay Wallets.
But at the same time, I would like to thank you all.
(Applause)
Thank you, Chris.
Hi. It's a wonderful way of having a massive way to have a leader, to do now what science science is tomorrow for the reality.
As a cybercriminal, I offer the elements of illusion and science, so that I encourage you to give you the opportunity to experience the technology of the future.
"Let's hear about Google headlines" "Jeopardy Glass" "."
It's a new technology. If you're looking through it, the world is spreading around the data: addicts of cities, directors, buildings, one day, perhaps, the names of strangers that you spend on the street.
This is my sluzzone's hidden.
They're a little bit large, it's just prototype.
When you're looking at it, they're going to give you a little glimpse into the mind of cyber-Groteonism.
I'm going to show you what I mean.
We need to just play a card. It can be any one.
So, I'm accusing it to know if we'll see it again.
Okay. Great brand.
Let's go back to the stream, I don't eat the doctrine, and let's start.
(Music) Voice: I'm ready. I'm facing the image.
Marco Tempbe: So for those of you who don't play — the deck of cards comes out of four colors: heart, cross, cow and drinks.
The mothers are among the oldest symbols, and they develop certainly different kinds of realizations.
Some people say that four colors are four-year-olds.
Jar, the summer, the faller and... Voice: My favorite year is cold. AT: Yes, my voice.
It's like magic. It's time change, it's tightly transformed into the cold, water on the snow, and then it's gone.
"He's 13 cards in the deck. (Music) Voice: Every card represents one of the 13-year-old" "Love cycle."
MT: So here's a bad thing, here's a trailer and in the middle is a moon.
Voice: The Moon is one of the most powerful symbols of magic.
MT: In the bundles of cards, there are two colors.
The red and the black, which is continuously transitioned and night.
Voice: Mark, I didn't know you can do it. (Laughter) (Applause) MS: And it's a coincidence that there's a five-inch card in the balcony, exactly what's in 52 weeks?
(Music) Voice: If we count all the points on the deck, the score is 365.
MT: Oh, 365, there's so much days in year, so many days is between everybody in the birthday.
"" "No wish." "(Audience: You don't tell me what's wrong."
MT: In fact, it was just my sixth birthday when I received my first bag of cards, and since then I travel around the world and girls, men and women, marriage and women, wife and wife, even for royals and women, even for royals and queens. (Applause) Voice: And who's this? (Applause) And who is this? MT: Ah, yeah. Look.
Wake up.
"" "Yellow:" "Whoa. MT: You're ready to show?"
(Video) Narrator: Ready! MT: So show what you can do.
"Narrator: I'm going to show you my hip here." "MT: Yes." "Author."
"" "Yellow," "Oh, okay, oh, oh! (Music) MT: But today, I'm making a projection for other audiences."
You know, for you.
Voice: An marked arm painted. Sorry: Sometimes me ask me how do you become magic? Do you have to work from nine to 5?
Of course, you don't! You have to save 24 /7.
I don't mean literally 24 hours in the week.
"24 /" "is a little bit hyperbolic, but there's a lot of dwarfing anybody." "Somebody might say that magic is a job of somewhat bad visual force. (Laughter) (Applause) (Music) Wow."
I'm just going to say, no.
"So Germany didn't use what's 9 nine. (Laughter)" "They're not monsters. But I have to cook you if you play with somebody who punishs your cards like this, don't play the money."
(Music) Voice: Why? That's a very good stick.
Shanny is 4,85: 1.
MT: Yeah, but I think I have better therapies. We killed statistics.
Voice: I think you've been working on the natural dog. (Video): And so there's just last, but the most important one of all cards: the card with a very relevant brand.
And unlike everything we've just seen whether no virtual or not. Voice: The acid of cards have provoked.
Diet MAT: This is why the real thing is.
(Video): Man. (Music) Thank you. (Applause) (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause)
I'd like to show you something that I've worked on.
Over the 30-day careers, I learned a couple of things.
This was part of the challenge, something from a picture every day during a month.
And I'd never found the courage to do that.
It's horrible.
On the contrary, it's a magnificent entertainment.
(Applause)
Hi. I'd like to share with you some of the things I work on.
Since we're still working on these works, we're moving into a huge amount of intimacy and a mystery.
So I'm going to try to describe some of the experiences that I've been trying to do.
So the first piece is called Immer Moneys.
Nothing in the room comes into the room and summon these panels as a non-founding composite on the wall.
Over the course of several seconds, like the panel noticed the presence of wildlife, it appears to be smashed and drowned with symmetrical socially.
(Laughter) This is the idea of two states.
The first is very mess. I'm a total siege.
And we've been wondering for a little bit of stuff from one state to another.
This reminded us also two very different artistic traditions.
The first one is the population of the 15th century, and the second one comes about 100 years ago, the Maldives of abstract composites.
So I'm going to show you video.
To give you a sense of true scales, the largest of panels is about two meters tall.
It's much more than that, and the little one is the size of A4.
So the odds will come into the coins, and they're right now.
And after a while the wildlife in the room, the panels become responsive to the presence of themselves in the room, and again they get autonomy, while they don't touch the presence or motion, and then they stand in the opinion again.
(Laughter) So this is what it looks like though the odds have caused a stream between panels, but it might be the other way, maybe the panels tend to be used in advanced behavior that the odds of the tanapots attached to the task of the battery.
So this brings me to a silent, smaller piece named Hadahll.
Dimlows sees a piece of paper hoping on the other side of the room, but if you zoom in, it's an empty letter A4 or an empty leafprint that sticks two tiny little hands out of tiny little tiny details and with high attention.
And the object sees that this whole sculpture is very slowly slowly, as if these two hands were trying to hold the sheets of paper in a very long time, and they're quite scared to them.
So this doesn't really satisfy the motions very much to remind the motions that we see through the Russian camera.
So here I'm going to show you two footage.
One of the landed gears, and the second one from the hand-to-a-half.
And you can see, as it doesn't, like this video represents the presence of an enemy and the subjective term of view.
So we just pulled the camera and we moved this movement on the panel.
So here's a video.
We have to envision a second hand. There's nowhere there.
But we're trying to deliver gestures of self-models, like this big piece of paper, somebody with your exposé hands.
This is actually miniaturization and very depressed by this piece of paper before they're demonstrating an enemy.
Another piece is the Decoy.
This is a card model, so the whole object is about as tall as I do.
"It's going to be a round body, two arms, and very high" "sugar" "space, and his only goal is to charge attention."
So when she goes a diver, she's going to start thinking about the side of the side and moving hands, continuously faster and faster, the more mate.
So this is the first test.
You see two movements together, and the whole object is trying to express desperate circumstances to help all of their beings.
But here's what's happened is because when you get your attention to a viewer, it's lost interest to start looking for someone else.
(Laughter) This is finished by the Decoy.
It looks mass manufacturing as if it's a factor, like it's fire or washing machines.
Because we're always working from a very personal space, like this consumption station to the same extent, and provides the footprint from his development.
So this is the same kind of gathered entity that tries to answer you from things that need your attention to actually need your attention, but it can be a creature that needs help.
Another piece is an object that is also a musical instrument.
There's a kind of paper that's a blueprint for the size of the audience from the eye to the stage.
So where I'm standing, every one of you looks like this big, and I'm going to spend my eyes on my visual field.
They're sitting in the audience here in the audience.
They're embedded to just clap your senses.
This means that every one of them can decide when they want to clap, how long, as long as they want to be affected by others or their intentions, and whether they want to participate in innovation.
So when the audience comes in front of the audience gets away.
It can be weak or strong enough, and then nothing doesn't fall until the wilderness doesn't leave the stage, and I publish the audience again.
The reality can be anything from a weaker (Appler) a few hundred jobs or very intensely enough.
What this means is we're looking at the audience as a self-reviewed object, as a self-reviewed trait that has an almost musical feature as a musical instrument.
So, texture can play a rather complex and diverse musical or vocal samples, but cannot publish the audience directly to any particular reaction.
So they have a certain amount of drugs, unpredictable and uncomfortable.
They also reminded the trap.
As you can see, there's a rather enthusiastic image of the head smashing into two hands.
Here's a little visual animation, as if the tide of the brain came down and try to understand the dynamic and the tension.
And here's a prototype.
So we don't know when we're going to have 996.
Alright, this is the last piece. It's called Frigerners.
It comes out of the principles.
This is the real window in our studio, and as you can see, it's a woodence of three different milestones.
So we've used the same language to create your locks that sit in the room that you can see from two pages.
And the whole kingdom, they're actually very quiet.
They're also three different sizes to figure out the angle of view or distribution on one plane.
Each one of these pieces can run forward or break down on the door and sum down behind two ladders.
So the difference from this very schematic Romantion, we wanted to do these creatures, almost bizarre, as if someone had taken them and physically moved from place to place.
I like to give you an idea to taste these characters as though they didn't worry about them, like they were happy and stable until they're not aware of the movement and they're not scratched at the nearest wall.
It's also something happening for us.
These characters are confined in this very, very hard lesson that reminds of incarceration, but they're also a firm, because it allows them to hurt anything but they haven't know anything about the world around them.
So all of these features I'm talking about are converted into a very specific technical configuration, and we had that gap to build the first prototype with ETH in the Peru.
So, as you can see, from our animations, they're removing the thrill to motion and create a kind of movement that's involved in the head and the direction and the direction.
So it's pretty small.
You can see I'd come to the bottom.
So imagine what we've done is when we saw it really work. Here's it.
(Laughter) Thank you.
(Applause)
And my initial conclusion was that they were just better people.
I can't tell people to work.
But where is the feeling from where?
It doesn't make any personal.
And when we felt safe, the natural reaction was trust and cooperative.
What that means is, in the night, I can fill and trust that someone from the trunk to meet me before I don't safe.
You don't have any control on those forces.
"" Why are you treating us as an age? ""
"" "Why can't you treat us as people?" "And she answered this:"
But they don't have the fear of their leaders.
It's not the numbers.
It's because they have violated the idea of leadership.
They have violated the deepest majority of societal principles.
They would never sacrifice people who were saving candidates.
"They sacrifice blood, and the tears and tears, to lock their eggs, and when we ask them," Why did you do that? ""
Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
I grew up in Limpoli, and I grew up to the borders of Limpoli and Mountiolangy, in the small town, called Movemma.
The water sources and resources of electricity are so inevitable, like the weather. I grew up in these non-surface conditions, and for example, when I was 17, I would jump with a few mates in the winter, and I was overwhelmed.
The sun in the provinces of Life can be very hot in winter.
"So as we do that, my best buddy next to me says," "Hey, why don't you need something that you just drag on your skin and you don't have to drink?" "And I sat down, and I said," "I'd buy it." "I went home, and I '
Today, it doesn't have over 2.5 billion people worldwide in the world to organize water and human responses.
40,000 million of them live in Africa and five million of them live in South Africa.
These are breeding all kinds of diseases in the environment, and the most radical is called the stodge.
The colony is an eye infection that gets touched in the eye. The more early infections can lead to a permanent blindness.
This disease has suffered eight million people every single year, and it's dwarfing that you have to avoid infections of the cabiome, you need to taste your face. Near no medications, no shots, no shots.
It looked like a secret cue on an amazing KFC museum.
So I said, okay, the recipe is a finish.
We have to bring it into practice.
"We're pasting four years — after I'd written a 40-driving business plan on his phone phone, and after I wrote a patent, I'm a young soldier in a country and —" "no buying a patent in the country," "and" "♫" "♫" "♫ ♫ I don &
You literally put it on the skin and you don't have to buy it.
(Laughter) So, what I've tried to do training in high school with limited resources, I went to university, I met a few people, put a product into practice, and now we have a fully functional product that is ready to lead to markets, and it's actually available for markets.
So we learned a few lessons about business and how they gave DryBothth.
Among other things, we've learned that the poor communities don't buy products in big.
They buy products to needs. People don't buy an entire bag of cigarettes, but thankfully one photo every day, even though it's expensive.
So DryBake sells in an industrial warning.
You're just climbing them in half and you tweak them.
And that's the best one that one quarter-of-grader is released by five-grades.
And after that model, we learned a lot about improving products.
We've learned that the rich kids have actually wanted DryBothth, (Laughter) at the time for a week.
So in any case, we realized that they could save the average of 80 Nice. Carre waters every time they save the bathroom, and we could save two hours a day that they live in rural areas — two hours more on a school, two hours more on your homework, for two hours more only to be a baby.
When we understood this global impact, we cut our key claims on clean and fields.
DryBath is a gift for the rich and rescuer of life for the poor.
What's the gate? (Applause) I didn't stop. I didn't stop.
The other important thing I learned during this process, the last year, Google turned me one of the most comprehensive parts of the world.
Now, I'm also a very best public entrepreneur in the world, the first African that has gotten so well, but one thing which has really favored, is that I just did it because I didn't want to buy it. Thank you.
(Applause)
So with that, I'm focusing on the truckload of my truck, I'd liked forget the patient?
It's a big part of national budgets.
And a lot of the different mammography is trying to shake this growth.
They don't need new medication in other countries, and they don't get to patients.
In a number of countries, doctors and nurses in a certain amount of fattoration.
They're wiping choices in health care, and they do the doctors and nurses.
You choose a expensive spray test, you choose you're going to have surgery to operate old and weak patients.
So by the limitations of the standard doctors, they can maintain low costs.
Finally, some doctors tell me that they don't have the absolute freedom to make decisions that they think are right for their patients.
"So we went back and we said," What do we do to do? ""
We call it health care based on values.
This was originally gorgeous in 2006 in 2006 in 2006, and they wrote Michael Porrter and Edzabet Tode.
You can see on this slide, my writing with my three gorgeous daughters.
If you compare the hospital in a country, you find that some of them are extremely good, but you also find a big amount of landscapes that are inherently worse.
The variations were dramatic.
Plant a coin. 50 percent risk. This is pretty much.
If she went to the Hamburg, the clinic, which is called Martin-Qaeda, the same risk would be only 1.2: 20.
But you know, and I don't know. We don't have information.
And often these data doesn't even exist.
No one knows.
So they go to the hospital as a lot.
But it doesn't have to be like this. It's hopeful.
On the panel, you see variations of metal streams, artificial Brader, which you would use for someone who needs a new hip of hip.
"" "Hey, we should measure this." "" "No, we should measure this." "
And since they agreed, they started measuring and started to share these information.
Everyone knew it was a sense of meaning.
They published every year.
They published a poetry table in a year: who's the best one who's the outcome?
It's also very happily, so it's a constant cycle of improving.
This principle affects a really exciting thing.
Doctors have touched, they're good at what's quality, and they're going to scale it, then they share information, they learn who's the best, and they learn from that.
It doesn't work better.
But, this is not the only exciting part.
This is a thrill of self.
So when you look at the story of a cement shop, the prenanny was invented study where the U.S. and Sweden was Sweden.
We worked a study where we focused on the OECD data.
The OECD has just been focused on the cost of care where the subjects in all of the member states.
That's 20 percent of the budget out of health care in the country.
We were always the best in class.
But most of them don't know that.
But doctors have another property.
They lie after fellows.
If a pacemologist is called another pacemaker in another sort of crocodile hospital, and they're talking about why the other non- hospital does have much better outcomes, they're sharing.
They're sharing the information as well.
Thanks to measure and producing excessive environments, we get a cycle of constant improving, which represents this picture.
So you can say, this is a nice idea, but this is not just an idea.
This is really happening.
You can think that this sounds like magic, but it's not magic, it's shortcut.
It's shortcut for International applications for measure outcomes in health care.
We're going to plan with eight diseases, and a year later, 16 years later.
Why is this?
We were sitting in workshops with doctors, nurses and other staffs, and we talked about childhood skulls.
The group was discussing how we currently swap the quality.
Can we measure it better than we do this today?
We were programming how to treat these children what they're trying to improve.
There was massive energy in the room.
Many ideas came out there and so much enthusiastic.
"He looked at a group, and he said," "He picked up your arm, I picked up your hand, coined the bath, and then the group said," Thank you. "
Thank you.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make you a few really surprising lessons about what's dedicated to society and that factories have in the successfulism of antique's success.
I just wanted to figure out what I wanted to do.
First, the idea.
I used to think that the idea is everything.
One of our first successes of Cinase magazine came when people wanted websites.
This is the motions we announced TED in 1998, when companies were looking for effectively enhancedness.
A remarkable idea, a great job.
YouTube didn't even have a business model.
And the best way to find that right is to look at whether customers really prepared them to offer them.
Thank you very much, you've been a great audience.
(Applause)
I went to share with you my photograph.
Or is it ever photographing?
Because this is a photograph that you don't do with your camera.
Nonetheless, my interest started when I received the first digital camera in 15 years.
It was a little bit different with my mind, but it was a bit different, because it was a little bit different, because it was used to the camera process in planning.
And if you do the camera with a camera, the process ends if you add to sleep.
I had a sense of photographing it was earlier to be in the right time in the right place.
I felt like everybody could do that.
So I wanted to create something different, something where the process begins when you do suspend.
The objects like this: the work on the bus road.
But it's got a unexpected way.
And yet, it's a certain level of controversy.
Or pictures like these — dark and colorful, but all along the common mission to maintain the level of action.
When I talk about the directors, I think, photo-rellowism.
Because of course, this is not something you could remember, but I still want it to seem to be taken as photo.
The objects where you need a long time to reveal that trick.
So it's more like the idea of the idea before he captured the moment.
But what's the trick to us to look specifically?
Is it some detail or colors?
Is it the light?
Leading that illusion?
Sometimes it's an illusion.
But in the end, what we're interpreting is how we're interpreting the world and how it can be taken on a two-dimensional top.
In fact, it's not about what's realistic, but what we think looks realistic.
So I think the basis are pretty easy.
I just see it as the ultimate point of reality, where you can take different parts of reality and put them together by making an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So we have three perfectly physical objects that are very well known in three-dimensional world.
But if we combine them in particular ways, they can create something that looks for three-dimensional, it seems to be there.
But at the same time, we know that they cannot.
So let's face our brains, because our brains simply don't accept the fact that it doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process in the Web.
It's actually just about being overwhelmed in different threads.
What makes photos realistic, are the things I think we don't even think about, things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But when you combine photographs, it's very important to think about it, because it's just something wrong.
So I would say there are three simple rules as the realistic outcome.
As you can see, these images aren't very special.
But when they hybridize, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective.
Second, combined photos should have the same kind of light.
And these two images both of these conditions satisfy — solve in the same height and the same world.
The third is to do it impossible to recognize where all of these images begin and then they end that they're going to be a portal.
Andby it wasn't going to tell you how a picture was constructed.
So I'm conducted colors and ribs and apples at the borders between several images, add pictures of photographheads, defined colors and noises, uncovered colors and noise, uncovering the boundaries between several images, and it's going to look like one foot, despite that one image can contain even hundreds of layers.
Here's another example.
(Laughter) Somebody might think it's just a picture of countries, and it's just the last time.
But this picture is actually entirely folded from the photos of different areas.
Personally, I think it's easy to build than finding it, because then you don't have to do trade-offs with ideas you have.
But it needs a lot of planning.
And since I got this idea in winter, I knew I had a few months to try to find different boats for parts of which the image is going to be.
So for example, this fish was taken on fish.
The tests are from different boats.
The pollen part was captured in the rock.
And yeah, a house on top of the island, I've been colored on red to look more lonely.
So in order to get the actual outcome, you have to plan for me primarily.
It always becomes an instruction, an idea.
Then it's about the combined of different photos.
And here's been anything that's very well-lyed.
And if you're involved a good job at the bottom of photos, then it might be a very beautiful one, and also very realistic.
They all need tools here, and the only thing that limits us is our imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Wait, Julian. Julian.
It's called WikiLas, your baby, during several last years, assembled more secret documents than all the other world's 40 million countries combined.
Is it possible?
Julian Ansanger: Yes, is it possible?
There's a tendency that the rest of the world's fourth media reveals such a bad job that one little group of activists is able to release more information globally than all the press in the world.
CA: So how does this work?
How do people steal the documents?
And how do you protect their privacy?
JA: It's this, if we know, the classic boards, and we have a lot of ways to get food to us.
We're using modern encryptions to transport things from the web, for heating feet, and we use legal juris communicaters, like in Sweden and Balgium, for achieving law protecters.
We're going to get a kind of email, conventional height, encrypted, or not, let's test them as a standard plain conversation, form them — which is sometimes quite difficult to do when it comes to a giant database of information — we share them for the public, and then we palprehend before the institutions and political attacks.
CA: So you're trying to deliver that the documents are legal, but, in fact, you never know the identity of the source.
JA: Yes. We recognize it very rare, and although we learn it, we learn that information earlier.
(Voice) Singing phones) Saci.
(Laughter) CA: I think CISA asks the code for TED. (Laughter)
So let's test an example.
This is something that you've done a few years ago.
If we show you...
So this was in Kenya a couple years ago.
Can you tell us what you've done and what happened?
JA: This is the report of the Kroll.
This was the secret feature of an information service that serves the Kenyan government after the election election in 2004.
A year ago in Kenya, Danold Dan had been at about 18 years old.
It was a peaceful dictator.
And when the Knights got to power — because of the vessels that were trying to remove in Kenya's Orthodoxy — they were all sort of wrapped up, and they applied to her, and one affected message, two million pounds.
And then the government holds up and used a political head on the Mountain that was, and still, it still is, the richest man in Kenya.
It's a holy suaral name of human Banks.
So I came there in 2007, and we managed to hold it in front of the elections — 28. Wow.
We announced three days after a new president Kibarc decided to join a man who wanted to get rid of the man, Dan Parark Moi, which is why this story pivoted for President Kikokk.
CA: And — to get a short time — wake about this message, Kenya didn't get out of the official resources, but I didn't exclude, and by your opinion, it affected the election.
JA: Yes. He went on the front page of the Guardian, and then all the countries in the neighborhood, in tents and South Africa.
And that's where the door got in.
And after a few days, she could still write the Kenya print.
Now, 20 days ago, he was running in the Canadian school, and according to the crisis of information services affected 10 percent of the voices that changed the election results.
CA: So your belief really dramatically changed the world?
J: Yes.
(Applause) CA: And now we're going to leave you now a short demonstration from this videoline guide.
Samic video is longer. But here's a short demonstration.
I truly argue that it's a compelling material.
Narrator:... forever save them, shooting.
I see the target, right, about four termbers, okay, with...
You can. Okay, shooting.
I'm going to know how you get them. They get pregnant.
He's going to tell me.
So, yeah!
"[" "Fat from the instrument" "chick." "Fantastic." "
He loved... Kronny two-some, Krosan two-some.
We have to download, now.
Okay, we served all eight pops.
I see two birds.
I mean, Roger, I have them.
Boy, here's two /s, we go.
Tops, Naddon.) What was it?
Saci, Kyle. OK, oh, I got them.
CA: What's the impact?
JA: In the people who worked in this medium.
We ended up by two people to the authority to find more.
This is just the first of three attacks that they have won.
CA: In that attack, 11 people died, including two employees Reuthers, right?
JA: Yes, two employees of Reuts and two children have been raped.
The moon was killed in 18 and 2,66 people.
CA: And this leads to the general outrage.
Now, think about you was a key demonstration that actually sparked the controversy?
JA: I don't know, I think people can see that not by forces.
You have people who raise themselves after the street and then the helicopter of Ahpathy, the kilometers from the foot of the 30-olimeter charges of all, searching for a reserve, and kills the people's raped.
And there were two journalists who were obviously not buried, because this is their job.
CA: And American authentic services, Birnay Manning, was arrested, and he'd say you gave you this video with the 280,000 secret telegrams of the American Embassy.
Did that do that?
JA: We've conquered the embrace of the telegrams.
About five days ago, he was accused of 150,000 telegrams and published 50.
At the beginning, we announced a telegram of American Eygenjay in Rechoacán, but they don't necessarily relate to that.
I was a famous survey of that embassy.
CA: If you've got thousands of diplomatic telegrams in the U.S.
JA: We would trust them. (Gaise: Yes?) JA: Why?) JA: Why?) JA: Why?) JA: Why do these things reveal true state, like, Arabic government, their real abuse of human rights violations.
If you look at the cagrams, there are materials like this.
CA: Let's take a little bit more compressive.
More generally, what is your philosophy?
Why is it the right to stimulate the secret information?
JA: It's a question that information is important in the world and what information can cause change.
There's a lot of information.
So when organizations are investing inside of any information, it's a good sign, that when information goes out, it can be helpful, because organizations who know them the best that they know from inside, they choose the efforts to welcome them.
And that's what we've learned from pigs, and this is the meat of journalism.
CA: But isn't the risk, whether or not for the individual person, or the whole company, that the widy can have unintend consequences?
JA: So I destroy what we've done.
We have our principles of protection.
We have a way to translate the information that incorporates personal — the data of a particular person.
But there are legal secrets — for example, your medical bags, they're legal secrets, but we're standing with impressions who are well-driven.
CA: So they have good motivation.
"AC: And what you'd say, for example, my parents who — the son serving in the American military, and saying," "You know what somebody wanted to publish."
Video is showing the American soldier that we eat as people die.
That leads to millions of people worldwide that American soldiers are nonhuman.
"That's not true. My son isn't. How do you find?" "What would you say?"
JA: Well, we hear that enough.
But don't forget that people in Banks, Iraq, Afghanistan — they don't need to see the video; they're seeing it every day.
So they don't change their opinion. We don't use them.
That's what they see every day.
I'm going to give it to the impressions that they pay for it, and that's our hope.
CA: So you find a way to illuminate things that you see as dark secrets and governments.
Light is good.
But can you see the irony that you couldn't freak on it, you have to store your resources?
JA: No. We don't have any WikiLs in Brazil.
We don't have resources that are dispersed by other sources.
If they discovered, it would be a difficult situation for us, but we behave so that people feel moral duty to continue to continue to do that.
CA: I would just wonder what we've heard of before — I'm curious about the idea in the audience of TED.
You know, there might be more opinion expressions for WikiLs and Juli.
So for instance, there's a hero that's carried to the important light.
Or perhaps a dangerous problem.
Who thinks it's a hero?
And who's a dangerous propossum?
JA: Well, someone is yes.
CA: They're confusing, Julian, softer.
We need to try and do more than we need another example.
Here's something you haven't done yet, but now you do it for TED.
It's a fascinating story that just became, right?
What is this?
JA: This is an example of what we do about every day.
So last year — in November last year — there's a series of explosions in Alaska, like in the Gulf of Mexico, but not so big.
And we've got a message — something like a technological analysis of what has happened — which said that conservation swarm oil companies reared trucks and put them in the air.
And it was also involved in this sort of amateur government, etc., etc.
And this technical news didn't have any leader, so it was an extremely difficult document for us.
We couldn't check it because we didn't know who she was.
So we've been skeptical whether it's not some advice of conventional oil.
"This is what we saw that, and they said," "We have doubt."
We don't know anything, but what can we do?
"(" "Love looks okay, it's right, but we don't know it." "And we got a letter this week from the company, and they wanted to reach resources. (Laughter) They said," "We want to find a source." "And we said," "
What are you going to talk about the documentary?
Can you show me that you have a law law?
"Is it your passion?" "So they sent this slide from screens with the author of the World War."
Yep.
(Applause) That becomes a lot.
This is one of our concepts of identifying — testing the materials, and this is where we find people who are prescribed.
CA: Do you have the information from BP?
JA: Yes, we have enough, but we're just solving serious financial and technical things.
That's why we've actually curvage a little bit about the last few months, while we create a planetary system for the public interest in the public.
That's a problem.
As each develop starting organization, we're overwhelmed by our own development, and that means we get enormous amounts of very important information from our boards, but we don't have enough people to work.
CA: So this is the big hurdle for all journalist volunteers and / AIDS funding journalists?
JS: Yes, and trusted people.
We're an organization that's hard to develop as a kind of material that we're working with. So let's devote ourselves to study people who have to work on national security, and then less serious things.
CA: Tell us something about yourself, and how you got to it.
I think I've read that as a child you walked into 37 different schools.
Could it be true?
JA: Well, my parents were in the movie industry and the TV drain, so the combination of these two...
(Laughter) CA: So the psychologist would say it's a formula for the development of paradisinos.
JA: What about the movies industry?
(Laughter) (Applause) CA: And you've been around the hackers and you've almost turned off with authorities.
J: Well, I was a journalist.
You know, I was a very young public and activist.
I covered a magazine, and because of him as a teenager, they were screening me.
So you have to be careful with the word's word.
It's a method that can be used in different ways.
Unfortunately, they're currently used in the Russian mass to sniff the ATMs in your grandmother.
So this phrase isn't as nice as it used to be.
CA: Well, I don't think you steal the bank associated with your grand piano, but what about your basic values?
Can you show us what they are and maybe some future in your life that they're sent to them?
J: I'm not sure of you.
But fundamental values: they're capable of lots of people, they don't care about the damage.
And that's something from my dad and some other capable and generous people who were in my life.
CA: Sopathy, generous people don't construct the sacrifice; they care about the sacrifice?
JA: Yes, I'm a fight man, so I don't know about people very much, but in a way — there's a different way of worries about the victims, and that's punished by the perpetrators of crime.
And that's something I have in my nature for a long time.
CA: So let's tell you another story: What's happened on the Island?
You've made something that you've done there, they've gotten in trouble with a mine and news services where they have received the banal.
Instead, they published your arm.
So they made you at the Island High promotion. What happened then?
JA: Yes, that's a great case.
Island was going through the financial crisis.
In the world, the worst of all countries in the world.
Their banking sector was 10 times bigger than GDP rest of the economy.
We published this message in the last year.
"And the public body received the ban to publish five minutes before the broadcast, fiercely, as in the movie, appeared on the table and the hosttors said," This hasn't done yet. What's now? ""
So instead, the website showed all the time broadcast, and we became very famous at Iceland and to talk about the Island and talk about it.
In the society, that's never going to happen, and the result is that we're dealing with some of the Mission politics and other international legal law experts built new balconies for Islam to become a portal for a single voice, with the strongest journalist of conservation in the world, with Nobel Prize-me-fomet winner.
Island is a Norway country, so, like in Norway, it's possible to penetrate into the system.
And just before the months of the seland, the laws were united.
CA: Woo.
(Applause) The last question, Julian. Julan.
When you think the future, you think it's more likely to be the Big Brothers going to have more control, more secrets, or instead, we're going to look at Big Brothers, or is it going to be everything else?
J: I'm not sure we're going to go.
There's a huge pressure for elected laws of speech and transparency all around the world — within EU: between China and United States.
How will it be developing? That's hard to predict.
That's why today's really interesting today, because only with small intentions we can move it in one or another direction.
CA: I think I'm going to express the idea of wonders if I say, Julian to be careful and I encourage you a lot of forces.
JS: Thank you, Chris. (Audience: Thank you.) (Applause)
"There's a guy who's looking at his dad, and he says," "Dad, when I grow up, I want to be a former president." "(Laughter) So as a former leader, I was big enough, because I had an opportunity to have many people in the world to know a lot of people around the world."
Not only, I know 50 states in the U.S., but with my wife, I visited over 145 countries in the world, and Carterridge constantly operates with 80 nations of Earth.
So our constant commitment in Carter center is to support human rights, and since I know the world as I know, I can tell you that I can tell you that the number one in the violated human rights on Earth is abused women and girls, what's causing why, talking often.
(Applause) So there's some reason why this is happening, and I'm going to start with them.
The first one is the wrong establishment of religious, sanctuary writers, the Bosnian law, the Old law, the Old laws, the Koran, the Koran, the Koran, the Koran, and so forth, and these are the wrong ruled men who are in the Iraqi backgrounds in the Huggas, the churches and the mosques.
And they're going to determine these rules so that women are reliable in the eyes of God based on another side with men.
This is a very serious problem. We don't choose it enough.
A few years ago, in the year 2000, I was South Baptts, at the age of '2000, and I still teach every Sunday school in a Sunday school; in a Sunday afternoon, I'll be teaching — South collection of Baeptios, in the year 2000, that women have to be only in the side century, in the service of men.
So they published the attacks that they basically kill women, trappings, seniors in the churches, or the capitalism in the military, and if women conducted a class in the Scott's offices, let's not learn if there's a boy in the room, because in Blackliio, there are over 30,000 lines that say women shouldn't teach a man and so forth.
But the basis is that the homi scripts are mistrusted to sustain men in a business position.
It's an ubiquitous problem, because men cannot publish that power and a future or employer, for example, want to encourage women, can you claim that if women are not equal in smoke, why would I have value to behave like Emma?
Another very serious insight that's the cause of this problem is an existential representation of violence, and that's a huge amount of peace around the globe.
For example, in the U.S., we have experienced enormous increase of abuse of poor people, mostly black and minority who have been transformed to prison.
When I was a BRIL, one of the 1,000 Americans sitting in prison.
It's in jail for 7.3 people from 700.
That's a 7-day increase.
And since I left the White House, 800,000 percent have increased the number of black women in prison.
We're also only one of the developed countries where the death penalty is.
And we're peering right now in countries that are most abusely abused all the forms of human rights, by supporting death penalty.
Now we're in California, and I realized that California had devoted four billion dollars to do that death penalty at 13 people.
When we count that, California pays a 307 million dollars for the item of one person.
Later this week passed the law of death threat because it's so expensive. (Applause) (Applause) We see that violence in the poor and without needless people is another reason for eating abuse of Mexico.
I'd like to give you just a few examples that I'm most screening, and I'm going to be briefly, because, you know, I'm just limited time.
It's a female siege.
"The oil landscape is cruel, and most American women unknown, but in some countries, when the woman's infant touched, in many countries, her so-called" "domestic" "totally uncovered" "impactful" "improving in the non-governmental environment, remove the outside of the women's interior."
And in some extremely, but non-smimily, sometimes a girl creates a girl only to mock or refine.
"And later, when it comes up, the" "stage" "and it opens it to have sex."
It's not a rare case, although it's a lot of countries in a lot of countries.
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of women who were disabled before to achieve adulthood.
This is a crisis crime in all the women who live in these countries.
Another exploitation that's a serious spike, is murdered from the virtue, causing the bad boxes, again, a sanctuary writing — in the Koran, there's nothing that's going to show — where the family advised a girl from a family, if he's raped or if he's been raped or even if he doesn't seem fanciful.
And they're actually providing members of their own family, so they become murderers, if the girl spends a so-called shame.
In Egypt's University of analysis, and that showed that 75 percent of these sufferers performed a father, uncle or brother, but 25 percent of these suffered women.
The other problem in the world that is most about women, is a slave, or a shop with people like this is called today.
Africa had been about 12.5 million people in the New world Act in January and 19th century.
Today, 30 million people live in slavery.
The United States of State University has now been conducted from Congress to give a year to a year, and the Minister of Finance is that 800,000 people have been temporarily buried into captivity, and of those virgins, there are 80 percent of women who are sexual slaves.
At this point in the United States, 600,000 people live in slavery.
In Atlanta in Georgia, where Carter centter is and I teach the ESPY University, each month before 200 — 300 people like women's slaves.
Because that's the first place in the U.S.
The Atlantic is the largest flight in the world, and there's lots of passengers coming from the South hemisphere.
If she wants to buy a girl with a brown or black skin, it can have a 50,000 dollars.
Girl with a white skin brings over 70 times so much, and the average wins in Atlanta and the U.S. taxpayers today for 3,000 dollars for a slave.
Bothed with sex in Atlanta reveals more than a whole store in Atlanta.
So this is another very serious problem, and the primary problem is a primorite, because in America, there's no only one who don't recognize local officials, police, police bosses or rebels and so forth.
And that leads to one of the worst problems that the women are increasingly corrupted and sexually taken in all countries of the world.
Sweden has a good approach to this.
About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden was to change the law, and women who are sexual slavery, they're no longer satisfied, but depressers and masculine customers, and, (Applause) — attracts the cases of prostitution.
In the United States, we have exactly the opposite approach.
In every man touched illegal trade in the United States, they were falling in the United States.
Canada, Ireland, Sweden, as I said, France and other countries now fought to this neat model.
That's one of possibilities.
We have two great institutions in this country that we all hear: our military and our new transportation system.
We're currently analyzing the military in the military right now, to the skin of sexuality attacks.
The last news I have is talking about the 2,6,000 of sexual attacks that volunteered in the military. 2,600.
There's only 10,000, something about one percent, and the reason that's that the infantry wounds of any organization — the ship like my submarine or a Balitón in military, or the crew in the military, or the crew of the creators, is the laws of the law to decide whether or not, and of course, the last thing that they want, is that someone knew that they ought to bury them sexualit
That law has to change.
About one of four girls who go to American university, facing sexual violence before they're going to get the title, and this is now a lot of controversy, and this is now a lot of controversy, and also others, and so, 89 Vivits in America were designed from the Ministry of Tim IX, because the leader of entropy doesn't care about women and don '
The Ministry of the Ministry of Finance says that more than half of rape schools are killed by violent violence, because if somebody are raped outside colleges will be attributed, but if they get in college schools, they may have raped.
They're not stigmated.
That's the kinds of things that have crops in our society.
Those are things that they operate.
At the top 50 companies, it's 23, and there's 23 out of 500 companies, 23 out of 500 companies, and these directors, I don't have to talk to you, earn less than the average of what other CEOs do.
So this is what's happening in our country.
Another problem with United States is that we are the most distant nation on Earth.
Since World War II, we've been in war with about 25 different countries.
In some cases, our soldiers were frightened.
Sometimes we flew over heads and mutilated on their desks.
In conclusions, like now, our unliplicated planes add people.
Since World War II, we were 25 or more diverse countries.
They were four years old, I don't know which we're — (Applause) — when we didn't throw a single baby, they wouldn't kill the only rocket, they didn't shoot a single instrument.
But one thing, these things, they augmented us and error interpretation of the sacred scripts are the primary causes of abuse and girls.
There's another fundamental cause I don't have to remember, which is, generally, men don't care about it.
(Applause) That's true.
The average man who says that it's opposed to abuse women and girls, quiet and accepted by the privilege of anarchy position that's very similar to what I've known as a kid, when there's tightly falling, but equals equals.
The Rami discrimination was actually 100 years old since 1865, from the University of the 1960s, since the '60s, when ["" the "" The "" The "" of "" The "" of "" The "" The ""
But in this time, a lot of white people who didn't think that the race discrimination is fine, but they didn't choose, because they've been privileged as a better job, a unique approach to labor school, better schools and everything else, and the same thing exists today, because the average men is one.
"Although she says," "I'm against the discrimination of women and girls," "she's enjoyed the research position."
So what's the fundamental thing to do today?
Ordinary women don't usually tell them how their daughters are cut and so forth.
I'm not even proud of that.
But I hope that from this conference comes out that every woman who is here, convinced his wife, that they have their daughters and the weights to protect abuse in their lives, in military, and so on and on working markets.
I have 12 grandchildren, four children and 10 truths, and I often don't think about the situation that they face in America or not only if they're in Egypt or somewhere in the realm of human rights, and I hope all of you will join me and advocate for women and girls around the world and they will protect human rights.
Thank you very much.
When I was here at Oxford in '70s, the future of the world was hopeless.
The inflation was unimaginable.
The entire world's mammography was inevitable.
The Academy of cancer, caused chemicals in the environment, had to travel the length of our life.
There's rain on the forest.
You've been spending a year for more than a kilometer.
The year came, and nuclear suffered with us.
But none of that happened. (Laughter) And miraculously, if we look at what's happened in my life, we'll find that the average income in one average inhabitants of planets, to elaborate development development, machines rapidly.
My life has increased since my birth has increased 30 percent.
Childhood kids have been reduced by two-thirds.
The process of food on one person has increased the third.
And at that all, the number of people doubled.
So as we've achieved it — we're just taking it for good or bad.
How did we do that?
How come we're the only species doing more than that more fits?
The size of points on this diagram represents the size of the population, and his level of GDP per capita.
I think the answer will get if we recognize how human beings put together their brains and allow the combined and ignite ideas, connecting them and freezing.
In other words, we have to recognize how ideas are.
Imagine how we got from the production of these subjects to manufacture these kinds of objects.
Both of them are real objects.
One is a handful zero from 5000,000 years ago by making Homo erectus.
Second, of course, is a computer mouse.
It's unusual that both of them have abundant size and shape.
And I was trying to figure out what's bigger, but it's almost impossible.
And because they're both formed for the human hand.
Both of them are technology. They don't even be so interesting.
He's been wondering that they've been complicized so that they have retreated into human hands.
But I'm interested in different circumstances, because the object on the left has been making uncutted changes over one million years, earning 1,5000,000 years ago.
The Homo erectus produced that same equipment through 30,000 generations.
Of course, discovered some change, but tools have changed slower than the coffee of people.
He didn't need progress, or innovation.
It's an incredible phenomena, but it's true.
Now, the object on the right is obsolete for five years.
And there's another difference, and that the subject on the left is made of one material.
The object in the right is made by a combination of different materials ranging to metals and plastics and so forth.
And that's a combination of different ideas, ideas of plastic, laser, idea of transistors.
It's all been combined in this technology.
And just this combination, this chasing technology is what fascinates me, and I think it's a secret to understanding what's happening in the world.
And my body is to accumulate ideas, ideas of skin cells, brain cells and liver.
It all came together.
How do evolution do this accumulation, this calendar?
It costs sexuality reproduction.
If they're discovering two different mutations in the animals, the tagged vegetables and red, one of them has to be better than a second.
One of the things that they can survive.
But if you're going to go across the table, then they can actually inherit both the bears from all the different threads of the beatings.
So the actual eye allows the individuals to get to the genetic enhanced of the whole species.
It's not limited to our own raping.
And how does they achieve the effective effect in cultural development, what is the sex in biological development?
I think the answer is a product store, they tend to scale one thing as another.
It's a unique human puzzle.
No animals don't do that.
It's actually going to learn in the labs to make sense of what's measured, of course, in animals, and the change of one object will never happen.
"About Adam Smith:" "This is where the dog could have done a fairly fixed trade of bones with another arm." "(Laughter) The culture without an improved shop can you."
You can have a completely overwhelming culture.
Chimarazzy, quashy sticks and such animals, they have a culture.
They're going to learn the traditions that are attracted to their offspring.
In this case, they're going to teach chimpanzees to each other, like they unfold eating nuts.
But the difference is that these cultures never flourish, they don't have religion, they don't buy, and that's because there's no sort of sex, there's no guilty of ideas.
Humans have different cultures.
It doesn't make sense of ideas among them.
So why do the cost of a life increase?
The answer has provided the answer in 18171 David Riododo.
And this is his story in the verium of the stone, although he'd like he told him in relation to the table between the country.
I'm going to make four hours a little bit and three hours for three hours.
He's going to make one hour of one an hour and two hours in the course of one an hour.
So it's also from Adama's better in making sures.
He don't need the Adams.
They can make their own arrowheads and nurses.
I mean, not fairly, because when you interview two / tomatoes and Adam two skirts and then they do business, both of them save an hour of work.
And the more that they're going to hold it, the more truth will be, because the more it will do it better, they're better going to go better and interact with the arrowheads.
So the Zetas of goods will still be attacked.
And this is one of the chambers of a guaranteed business that actually creates momentum for a wider specialized site, which then creates a hybrid power for more gears and so forth.
They both saved one hour.
This is a prosperity, a redefine of time to satisfy the requirements.
Ask yourself, how much time you would need to work in order to spend one hour to read the night tonight.
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you're going to go to the rural areas.
You'll find a sheep. You kill it. You get knocks out of it.
You panic it. You make your fame and so forth.
How long do you last for a long time? Pretty long.
How long have you have today today to do an hour to read, if you live in Britain and you have average payrolls?
The answer is that perhaps half a second.
In 1950, you would have to work eight seconds of average wages to take place as much light.
And that's a seven-and-a-half second second, which you've gotten. I mean, since 1950 is seven and a half seconds if you can do something else, or you can buy another good or service.
And in 1800, it would take 15 minutes to go from average wages to an hour.
In 1800, you would have to work six hours to make sure you would make an hour.
In other words, average earning average person could not afford a candle.
"So let's go back to the picture with a hand clip, and we're going to pick up a question:" "Who and for whom they made them?" "They made someone for themselves."
He'd been very static.
We call it poverty.
But the object in the right has made other people for me.
What many people do?
Vaneys? Do you ?00?
I think they're actually millions.
Because we have to calculate a man who grows a coffee that served for a man who serves the oil patches that had to make plastics and so forth.
They all worked for me to make me disappear.
This is how society works.
We've done this as a species-like species.
In ancient ages, when one person was rich, people worked in it literally.
You just could be the dinosaur, you had to hire them.
This is a XIV. It was a huge amount of people.
They produced the ridiculous costumes like this one. (Laughter) And they were doing their ridiculous hairs.
He was 498 people who were preparing for him every day.
But also the modern tourist that goes through Verslille, and they look at the images of the creator XISA, 2,98 people who lead to dinner.
These are people in biraps and restaurants, restaurants and shops around Paris, and they all are ready for hours to do with an excellent dish that's likely more qualities than the Open XISA.
This is what we've done because we're all working one for the other.
We're able to exploit the specialists and the exchange store so that we've become a living level.
Of course, they're the animals that work for each other.
Physical examples are ants: workers work for queens and vice versa.
But it's a big difference in that it's happening only within some kind of colony.
There's no connection between colonies.
And that's what they're going to do for an iPod cell.
I mean, they specialize on reproduction.
That's the old-year-olds.
Our species don't like it so much.
It's the only thing we want to do for ourselves — breeding.
(Laughter) Even in Britain, we don't leave the instructions to Britain.
(Applause) So where did this custom be invented?
And how long do they do? What does this mean?
I think his own old faith is about gender deserts.
But I don't have any evidence on it.
But it seems like the first one we've done to work for a woman and a woman for a man.
Today, in each criminal and gatheringers, there's a charter of work in terms of food shelves and women of collecters.
It's not so easy, but they're cheering specialized oil oil and women.
The beauty on this system is that it's benefited for both sides.
This woman knows, in this case, the coddus — that he's chasing roots to eat themselves — knows that if they want to get to meat, you can just kick a few roots and replac them for meat.
And they don't need to help drivers to mate.
And the man knows that you don't have to worry if the horse wants to have roots.
It's going to happen if the contraction is going to be quite big enough to share.
So they're actually giving birth to each other's lives through M4.
When was it all started? We don't know, but it's possible that the Neanderthal didn't do that.
It's been working in big operations.
The chickens were very smart.
The horse was the average of their brain average than my or any one of you in this room.
They were invented. They were dead.
It's probably the language, because now we know that they had the same gene FaOX222 than we discovered here in Oxford.
And it seems to have language skills.
They were organized by people. I don't want to embarrass them.
But we don't have the evidence of diarrheaby.
We don't have proof that women have devoted Obama.
It seems that women worked with men on their hunt.
And another thing that there is no evidence for sure is a product supply between groups, because the objects that can be found between non-flowers, made instruments, are always from local materials.
So for example, there's resonance, for example, find out the draft with local instruments in Canada.
They're always made out of the local corners.
They're actually human sieges from the same time advanced by 300,000 years ago, and some of them are from local corners, but most, many are made out of the scadge, comes from where they come from.
And when people started dying objects, it proves that they traded their groups.
It's 10 times as old as agriculture.
Humans forget it. They think they think of the modern invention.
This process between groups of people are doing over hundreds of thousands of years.
And the first evidence is spreading in Africa from the 1980s — 120,000 years ago when we see that they're going to have rampants and lakes moving in Ethiopia to large distances.
We see flying — as a team of scientists here in Oxford — they're going to travel 200 kilometers from the Silver Sbasa to the inland.
This proves that the people started with the spending table between groups.
And this eventually led to specialization.
How do we know that speeding big distance is a store, isn't migration?
It's going to happen if we look at the modern and viral, hunters and gatheringers who have benefited the rock to the room called Mt. Is, the belongs to the ownership of Kallkaon.
They exchanged their neighbors in their neighborhoods, and they got the stone nurses into a huge part of Australia.
Funting tools to large sums is a character of trade, not migration.
What happens if people make change, the ability to exchange and specialize?
The answer is you can not just slow down, but you can mimic the footprint.
So here's an example from the Tose.
When sea levels came down and Tasmieberg became a battery, people aren't been only involved in the slow development, compared to people to land, but they experienced actually imaginatively.
We've surrendered the ability to make tools from bones, fishery vessels and dresses, because the number of populations, about 450,000 people, wasn't big enough to bury the specialized officials necessary to maintain the technologies that they had.
That's just like all of us assembled the island.
How many of the things we have in the pockets, could we continue to build 10,000 years?
But this wasn't on the Gulf floor, a similar island with a similar population.
The reason that's because there's a swayway ground from South America's extensive dunes, and through the streets, it's devoted a business sum in the last 10,000 years.
Tammians were isolated.
So let's go back to this slide, and let's not just do whatever the object did, but do you know who knew how to do it?
In the case of the stone nurse, a person who had made it knew how to do it.
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?
Nobody. Absolutely no one.
No one on this planet doesn't know how to make a computer mouse.
And I think seriously.
The society of companies don't know it.
He just knows how to accommodate a company.
The human line doesn't know, because they don't know how to do the oil drill to get to the oil that makes plastic and so forth.
We're all familiar with lots of pieces, but no one counseles all the time.
"Let's face, quote from a famous Leonardo Read, the economist's economist, known as" "I," "as" "I," "witness," "in which he's writing about how a charity is produced, and as no one knows how to make it, because those who are
So, as human society, we're through augmentation and communities create the ability to make things that we don't even understand.
It's different than in the case of language.
In language, we have to reward the ideas and ideas we understand.
But in technology, we can make things that transcend our own capabilities.
And the pace of human minds have crossed into a remarkable amount.
And by the way, that's one of the reasons I don't care about IQ, or some groups have higher IQ than others.
It's pretty uncomfortable.
For a society, they're essentially as people share their ideas and ideas and how they work together, not, if they are individuals.
So we made something that we call a collective brain.
We are just locked in nets.
We're neurons in this brain.
And it's a challenge of ideas, linking and crossing ideas between what leads to technological development, gradually after a piece.
So any terrible things would happen.
And in the future, we're programming forward, of course, emotional things.
They drained wars, economic crisis, natural disasters.
I'm quite sure that in this century, they're riding terrible things.
But I'm sure that through the contacts that people make, and the possibility of connecting and sharing ideas like we never before, I'm sure technology will do progress, and with disabilities.
Because through a cingvaccoming, through craps Circle and through the world of the evil world we've created, we're not just mess, but everybody can have your own ideas, connect and cross them, and we certainly save peace innovation.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Amito.
So 18 months ago, I was working in Google to something else, but I was doing the idea of how to create something about the museum and the art of my boss, which is currently here, and she was approved.
It took my 18 months.
I'm going to tell you that this project accompanied a lot of happy interviews and stories with 1700 countries from nine countries.
But I'd like to focus on a demonstration to the Web.
There's a lot of stories that we do.
I think my personal story is very simply explained in the picture, and this is the beginning.
I grew up in India.
I've got a great education, I can't land, but I didn't have access to many museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and darker museums, I learned a lot.
And while I work in Google, I strive to have worked on delivering this dream of what's most about aid.
So we created a team, a big team of people, and we started working on it.
I'm going to try to get into the present program, and then I'm going to give you some interesting things that we've done from our beginnings.
So you just go to the PAPPstic Liber.
You're looking at how museums are available.
You're going to find here museum Uffzia, MoMAM, Rwanda, museum, museum Gowanus.
I'd like to go into one of my favorites, Metropolit's museum art in New York.
They're two ways you get inside the inside, it's very easy.
You click and, boom, you're in the museum.
It doesn't matter where you're currently there — BAT, Mexico, really doesn't really matter.
You're going into inside, you're freaking.
Do you want your friend to do your self?
Open plan and one click in the slide.
You're there, and you want to go to the end of the corridor.
Keep shouting, smile.
You study.
(Applause) Thank you. I didn't get the best again.
(Laughter) So now I'm one of my favorite paintings from Beijer Bageral in Meuporal Museum in Melosevelt museum.
"I see the mark" "impact" "sign."
If I present the image, we click on it.
This is one of the screens.
It's all based on the platforms.
Those of you who're really interested in art can click here — I'm going to click right now.
This is one of the screens we captured something we call the vaginal technology.
So this image, for example, is about 10 billion songs.
"About people ask me," What are you going to get 10 billion drinks? ""
So I'm going to try to show you what you're doing with 10 billion pillars.
You can just approximate a picture very simply.
Here you can see there's something joy here.
I like this guy, his insight is amazing.
But you want to get depressed.
So I started moving around and found something that was happening here.
"I said," "Wait, that looks interesting." "And I kept and noticed that those kids were believing."
I made a little survey, and I was talking to several of my contacts from the Meropolit museum museum, and eventually I realized that this is a game called the snacking game, and he's in the respected hip of a squir alarm on the tar Tupper.
Obviously it was very popular.
I don't know why they did that, but I learned something about it.
If you want to get a deeper, you can see the forces.
To give you that from a particular perspective, I'm going to let you see what we're going to achieve.
Here we were, and this is a painting.
(Applause) The best one comes — a second.
We're going to jump into MoMA, again in New York.
The next one of my favorites, the Hocane night, an example I showed you was the details of detail.
But what if you want to see the retina?
What if you want to see, like Van Goghh actually created this masterpiece?
You zoom in, and you really get to the depth of painting.
We're going to get to one of my favorite parts of this drawing, with a smaller force.
This is a soap night, as anybody ever could ever see it.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite personality.
There's a lot, but I have little time.
This is a really amazing part. It's called Zambia.
Any of you, it's one whether you're rich or poor if you have abundant house — doesn't care about it.
You can go and create your own museum, and you can create your own collection from all of these screens.
It's very easy, you're going to get it, and I've created a collection called the Vemplation — you just can still be approached.
This is Viviancients, placed in the National headline.
You can describe things, to send your friends, to start a conversation about what you feel when you walk through these migrants.
To conclude, I would like to say that for me, it's probably the most important thing that all of these wonderful work doesn't really go from Google.
They don't, presumably, even from the museum.
Maybe I shouldn't talk about it.
In fact, they come from those artists.
From that comes my modest experience.
I want to say that I'm trusting this digital medium whose artistic work fills and encourages it represents the gold.
"Probably the most challenging question I'm going to ask is," "Do you do it because the experience of walking into the museum?" "The answer is," "Me."
But that's why I'm going to finish it.
And that's it. Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you. (Applause)
My name is Jan McGonigal. I'm a design engine.
In the world of video games, we really hit it more.
The March of the 2012 population has spent 5.93 million years of solving virtual issues of Arizonathan.
It doesn't have to be something bad.
We're going to mess up in the smarter and easy breeding species.
And in the end, we're building the more massive social relationships.
It's going to use five million people every month.
That's the problem I'm trying to solve.
His piece is amazing. It explores why
But that's not the optimal situation.
The real world has to start to look like playing.
It wasn't until the wonderful bliss, we had a comic book.
People suffered. They were scared to me.
It's really exciting.
Here's what he says about 18 years and so the king chose to play one last game in cubes.
We're trying to imagine perfect illusions, and then we want to give people the policies to do them.
We created this game in 2007.
You're going to give you a wonderful story and adventure.
We've got momentum, and we have a pattern-like system as a knowledge of surroundings, connecting knowledge, sustainability, inspire and inventability.
"And my" "finger thought" "is a very simple idea which can potential billions of amazing ideas that we have in the act."
And this is the common thing, which can do that is a sleep.
— laughter — laughter — (Applause) — this is a room full of successful women. This is a room.
It's all severe women.
I've learned a little bit of sleep on my own horse.
Two and a half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion and ceremony.
And I was heading my head on the table and breaked so much credit, which I had five stuts on the right eye.
So I started a journey of reinventing the importance of sleep.
Through this period, I've been studying with specialized doctors and scientists, and now I'm here to explain that the only way to the productive life is full of blindness and meetings lead to enough sleep.
(Applause) Now, women, we're going to play a major role in this revolution. It's like science of women.
"They literally said," "We're going to fall down to the summit." "And literally."
(Applause) — (Applause) Because America is a deficit of sleep as a symbol of men's office.
Recently, I woke up with one man who was chasing that the last night was only four hours.
"I'd like to say," "but I didn't tell him — I wanted to say," "You know what?"
"If you run five hours, this lunch could fit much more interesting." "— laughter — there's one kind of scary of sleep constantly faded and successful people."
"Here in Washington, if you want to meet someone and you say," "What about eight?" "I mean," "Oh, eight is too late. But that's okay." "But that's okay. So that's okay. I'm going to play a couple of talks and then
So, high to the IQ.
It doesn't mean you're good leaders. It's a ability to see the iceberg before it hits Titan.
And they had massive amounts of glaciers in our Titanics.
"I really feel like the company Lehman Brothers" "was Lehman Brothers and sisters, and Sisters brothers still would work." "(Music) BB: They would still work 15.09,238."
"(Applause) Whereas all the" "Later" "were highly disturbed every single day in a week, maybe some of the attribute" "enemy" "at the 70-hour / 11 or eight hours of sleep, and it would be able to see things in a wider context."
And so while we are confronted to all the crisis of the present world, what's good for us to give us more pleasure, gratitude and efficiency into our life, and what's good for our career is also the best for the whole world.
So I'm asking you, put your eyes up and discover enormous ideas that they're working in you and show the power of sleep.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Well, as Chris said, I study human brain — functions and structure of the human brain.
Keep on a second about what's communal.
Here's this hybrid mass — one.4 kilograms of hits, which you're going to fit into the bottom, and it can break down the infinite areas of the cross-war space.
It can break down an infinite infinite, and it can prove that I'm going to break down the sense of it.
And this is a very captivistic trait that we call the self-evident, which I think is the Slow Gritic neuroscience, suggests, hopefully, one day we understand.
Okay, so how do you study this mysterious organ?
What I want to do is you have 100 billion nerve cells, a little bunch of chips that interact with and out of this activity emerge all the spectrum of the capabilities that we call human nature and human consciousness.
Now, what is happening?
Well, there's lots of ways to integrate human brain functions.
One way we're mostly used is studying the patient with a permanent lesion brain of the brain where the genetic change in the small region of the brain.
What happens then is not entirely distinguished entirely in your mental capacity, something that's a way of thinking about your ability to think.
What's going on is a very selective loss of one function while other functions contain intact and this gives you some confidence in the claim that this part of the brain is sort of involved in the media-making process.
So you can link the function of the structure and then find out what these circuits do to create this particular function.
So this is what we try to do.
Let me show you some surprising examples.
In fact, I'm going to show you three examples in this talk, every six minutes.
The first example is an extraordinary word called CRapags syndrome.
If you look at the first image, these are volcanic lobes, faced lobes, the lobeal lobes — the lobes that produce brain.
And if you look, the curves in the inner surface — you don't see it — it's a small structure called the fractal gyre.
And that's what we call a face brain brain, because when you damage, you can't recognize human faces.
You can still recognize people on your voice and say, well, that's Joe, but you can't look at their face and tell who that's what it is.
You can't even recognize myself in mirrors.
"I mean, you know you're out because when you poke," "and you know," "and you know it's a mirror, but you don't recognize ourselves as self."
Okay. This is a good famous consequence of damage damage.
But there's another rare God, actually so precious that you have heard of very little doctors, even in neuroscience.
"This one" "Capagura" "and it's an educational patient that's differently normal, and he's going to pick up the rope injury, and she's going to pick up the rope, and it's completely okay, look at my mom and says," "These women, looks like my
"It's kind of another woman who pretends to be my mom." "And now, why is this going on?"
Why would anyone — and this person is completely sharp and understood in all directions, but watching his mother's Facebook commander and tell him that it's not a mother.
The most challenging engagement of this, which you would find in all of the psychotter textbooks is the Freuadian view, which is that this guy — by the way, the same arguments for women, but I'm going to talk about men.
When you're a kid, a baby, you're feeling sexuality sexuality to your mother.
This is the so-called Fread Ovinyer complexity.
I don't expect to believe that, but it's a standard Freydic view.
And then, as you grow, the cerebral cortex is evolving, and suppresses these hidden sexuality reactions to your mother.
Thank God, because otherwise you would all be sexually engaged at your mom.
And then they're going to happen, you're going to go into your head, and you kiss the cortex, and you allow this hidden sexic desire to turn on the surface and at once, they don't realize that you're having your own mother.
"And you say," "My God, if this is my mom, how come I'm sexually excited?"
"It's a kind of other woman. It's a trick." "That's the only explanation that gives your independent brain meaning."
It's never been very powerful to beat.
It's very sophisticated, like all of the Fready arguments, but he didn't give me a big sense, because I saw the same beat, the patient with the same self-inflage. (Laughter)
"He says," "Children, this is not File, it looks totally like Fold, but it's a different dog." "Yeah?"
So, let's take the Freadian explanation.
(Laughter) You're going to hear about the hidden clatien inside of all the people, or something logical, of course, which is absolutely unknown.
So, what's really going on?
Well, the explanation of this remarkable disease is to look at the fabric and the function of normal vision in the brain.
Well, the interesting visual signals enter into our eyes, and they travel into visual areas of the brain.
In the hind part of the brain, it's actually about 30 areas of invitations that are only vision, and by processing that, towards acting into a small structure called a quantum array where you're experiencing the face.
They're attached to the neurons in the face.
You can call it the face of the brain.
I was talking about it before.
When this brain region is damage, you lose the capacity to see faces, right?
But this area has gradually led to structure called an Artode system, an emotional core of the brain, an emotional core brain, and this structure, called animal, measuring an emotional importance of what you're looking at.
Is it a correct? It's a predator? It's a partner?
Or that's something that's completely trivial, like a piece of cakes, or a piece of chalk or — I don't want to show it or a substance or something like that? Okay?
Something that you can completely ignore.
So if applied is activated, and this is important, the act of the coffeehouse to lead to the autonomic nervous system.
Your heart begins beating faster.
You're going to sink down, so you can get rid of the warms that you're going to make in the muscle.
And that's tough, because at your bottom, we can put two electrodes and measure the changes of the horses to release the bullets.
So if you look at something, I can actually do if you're broken or if you're not fire or not, yeah?
And I'll get to that moment.
So my idea was that when this guy looked at an object — or anything, it goes into visual areas and — and each time, it's processed in a phenomenal way, and you recognize it as play or a table or, say, your mother, yeah?
And then the news then migrates into an alterodall and then down to the autonomic nervous system.
But perhaps this guy, the connection between almond and lemonioric system — the emotional core of the brain — at the accident of the accident.
"So, because the default balance is unruisted, guys can still recognize your mother, and say," "Yes, it looks like my mom." "But because it's a link in emotional censorship, says," "How is it possible if this is my mom, I don't accuse any room?" "Or horror,
"(Laughter) And therefore he says," "How do I take this undjective point of emotion?"
This cannot be my mom.
"It's a stranger who's going to show for my mom." "How do you test it?"
Well, if we take any of you, and you're standing in front of the screen and we're going to measure the monovanvan tendency of your skin and grab images on a canvas, I know how you can see objects, if you see objects, like a table or a stable machine — of course, you don't.
If I'm going to show you a picture of lion or tiger or blue, you'll start sweating, right?
And, you know, or not if I show you a picture in your mother — and I'm telling you about normal people.
You don't even have to be alive.
(Laughter) So what happens if you show this patient?
You take a patient and you meet images on a canvas and make it a supvanvantic reaction.
Three and chairs, nothing doesn't happen, like normal people, but when you show them a picture of his mom, the slvanvan-like answer is flat.
There's an emotional reaction in its mother because that's the connection that leads from the visual area into an emotional center is interrupted.
So his eyes is normal, because the eyes of visual areas are normal, his emotions are normal — it's going to happen, it's going to be crying, and so forth — but connection to emotion is interrupted, and that's why he suffers from the emotion that his mother is fraud.
It's a love example of kinds of things that we do, let's take a bizarre, seemingly useless, neuroppychical Boty, and sorry that the classic Froddsky view is the wrong thing, because you can actually encode it in terms of familiar neurotune brain's terms.
"Mom, if this patient, his mom from neighboring room called" "phone" "— and he lifts his head off and says," "Wow, Mom, how do you get? Where are you? Where are you?" "The phone doesn't exist."
"Then the wait comes down, and he says," "Who are you guys?"
"You're looking at exactly my mom." "Yeah?"
And the reason is, there's a department of a demonstration from audian center in the brain to the centerpiece spectrum, and that's not been mured in the accident.
So this explains why my mother's phone doesn't obey.
But when she sees it personally, he claims that he's fraud.
I mean, how is this complex wiring pattern in the brain?
Is it the nature, genes, or is it fair?
What we're going to do is we're going to see another interesting word called phantomy limb.
And you all know what's a phantome limb.
And if we amuse your hand or leg, because of gangs, or you lose them in war, for example, in the war in Iraq now, it's a serious problem — and it's very alive to reconcile the presence of missing hands, and that's what we call the phantomene hand or the foot.
In fact, you can actually experience that kind of phantom near every part of the body.
Believe it or not, even in the innerness.
I had patients with a gatekeeper — the hysteromets — which had a fractal master, including the New York Ages at the right time of month.
Now, one student asked me if they had an adult driven?
(Laughter) The next science of science, but we didn't go.
So the next question is, what's about snormats you can learn from the experiments.
One of the things we've discovered is that half the patients with mild limbs say they can move with their own spectrum.
The blind brother washed on shoulder, they picked up the phone when they were called an attack.
These are very impressive, alive feelings.
Compassion doesn't suffer by a puzzle.
It's not even though it's not even a very well-being experience for the patient experience.
However, about half the patients, it doesn't happen.
"Fantastic gut — they say," "But Mr. doctor, that phenomenal limb is delicious."
It's like a prairie, zrippers, and it doesn't initiate.
If I could just wrap myself up with it, maybe I would be wondering from pain. Why wouldn't you be a feminist limb?
It sounds like a management.
But when we looked into the conservationists, we found that in these people with quadrorological limbs, the original hand was paralyzed from the cause of the hebrew.
The real barard hand, he was distorted, he was cut, let's say, in the Mozapsy accident.
So the patient had a real hand who was sent, a few months or a year drowned in the pop, and then the soap attempted to deliver his surgeon's surgeon in his hand, and he had a fractal hand with the same pains.
And this is a serious clinical problem.
The patients have been depression.
Some of them resist suicide.
So, how do they treat that the syndrome?
Why create the siltainomy bounce?
And when I looked into the news, I discovered that patients had a real hand and nerves that had been cut, and the real hand, swoll and swearing a few months before the alarm and this pain committed to the phobias.
Why are we going to go?
"And when your hand wasn't violated, but he'd smelled the slipways in his hands, saying" "knees," "but he got the exotic feedback loop" "No." "No. Ah. No. It's not. It's not. No."
And this is actually locking into the circuits in the brain, and we call it enough heat, okay?
The brain learns, the process of this Himalayan military network that a prospited table is making a feeling of taste clothing.
And then once we're going to kick down the arm, this chasm sticks down into your mindset and into your index.
But how do they help us?
How do you respond to an euthanasy stuff so you think about the monolyothy, gripping a biding of a phantomy hands?
Well, let's say, what if you sent a phantome Age but gave him an intense feedback cue that his chances to your headset?
You might be able to strike away from the corporate pain, phantasic fluids.
How do you do it? Well, a virtual reality.
But it costs millions of dollars.
So I've run a way to do it for three dollars, but don't throw it my sponsor.
(Laughter) Okay? What do you do is you create what I call a mirror box.
You have a card box with a mirror in the middle and then you put philanthropy — so my first patient, Derek, came up.
Hand's rapated six years ago.
He had cut armed, so the nerves were cut, and the arm was scavored, and then they were lyoked in the pop side, and then it was amputed.
He had a holiday hand, he doesn't smell pain and he couldn't move with her.
It was epic with a spectacular arm.
So I came there, and I gave him this mirror in the box I call mirror boxes.
"" "Party Awards" "cartooning hand" "which is all shrimp at the left side of the mirror, a healthier arm on the left side of the mirror, and put it in the same position, an emergent position looked into the mirror and they survived?"
He's looking at how his symphony is alive because he's looking at his healthy hands in the mirror, and this seems like this entire fantasy is alive.
"" "Now, I say," "I'm going to look at the look, to cross your fans — your true fingers or the knee-dddded vibrators, till you're going to look inside the mirror." "It's going to be the window I'm moving."
"That's the obvious thing, but the most surprising thing is, the patient says," "Oh my God, my index is moving around." "And you remember, my first patient who came in — (Applause) — Thank you. (Applause) So my first patient came in, looked into the mirror, and I said," "Look at the sudden
It's the mirror suddenly, but it's a living sense of experience.
"Now, I said," "He's my healthy hand and phantome." "He says," "Oh, I can't move my fans. You know," "Oh, it's painful." "And I said," "Oh my God."
And my pain is gone.
"Then I said," "Get your eyes." "He squirt his eyes."
"" The knee your health hand. ""
"" Oh, nothing is going wrong again. ""
"" Okay, create your eyes. ""
"" Oh my God, oh my God, goes up. ""
And he looked like a child in the sugar.
So I said, okay, this demonstrates my theory of an evacuation and crucial role of vision, but I won't avoid Nobel Prize worth that I'll help someone to move his feminist limb.
(Laughter) (Applause) When you think about it, it's a completely different ability. (Laughter)
But then I started to realize that perhaps other kinds of quadrinos you can encounter in neuroscience, like dead, protective dyssion — can be a certainly mimicable ingredient that you can actually overcome a simple battery for using mirrors.
"So I said," "Look, Derek" "can't all have anywhere to freeze a mirror on their own pain — I said," "Look Dereak, take it home and give it a week or two."
"Maybe after some time you break your wheels without mirrors, you're going to break your arms up, and then you're going to go through your pain." "So he said," "OK, and he'd go to her home."
"I said," "Look, they're two dollars. Take your home." "So he took him home and after two weeks called me and he said," "Dad, this will not be trusted." "I said," "What?" "And he said,"
"(Laughter) He said," "No, no, you know, do you know that frustrating, what have I done for 10 years?"
"He said." "And I said," "I'd like to worry, my God, my God, I want to say, changed his picture of a body where the human page was represented, okay, and all of that?"
"And I said," "Hey, are you worried?" "And he said," "No, the other three days I didn't have a feminist arm, and then no physical pains, no animals, no physical pain before, all those pains are gone."
"But the problem is, I still have total magical fingers from my shoulder, and your box gets there." "(Laughter)" "So, you could change design and give me the courage, so you know, they reached and could remove your feminist fingers?" "I thought I'm a magic."
So, why is this going?
It's so, because the brain is confronted with a huge cerebral contradiction.
The news comes from the news that the fitness is back.
On the other hand, there's no subjective perception, so the muscle signals say there's no, okay?
And your movement mass says that the arm is, and because of this conflict, the brain says, it's not any spectrum here, there's no door.
It gets into a certain form of thrusters — denial signals.
And if you go to a hand, a bonus is that it's gone because you can't have a pain, because you can't have minor pain riding in space.
So that's a bonus.
Now this technique was refined to dozens of patients in Dutch, so they could show up as valuable treatments of the finance of the finance and indeed, people tried it to the rehabilitation of dead.
You think about deadly, you think about damage, nothing that could do something about it.
But it turns out that a certain component of resurrection is also attacked, and maybe this ingredient could overcome using mica.
This also suffered clinical trials and helped lots and lots of patients.
Okay, let me go to the spinal part of my talk that's about another interesting phenomenon called the patriarchy Way.
It was discovered by 200 million in 19th century.
He was a cousin Charles Darwin.
He suggested that some people in the population who are in the other directions completely normal, had the following curve — always when they saw the number, was colorful.
The summit is blue, the seven-olled, Golden green-grader, a nine-by-a-a-a-half square.
Remember, these people are normal in all kinds of normal.
Or a high C. Sometimes the gyrus emitted into the color.
The tallest bird is blue, high-band, but another one can be yellow, yeah?
Why is this happening?
"It's called the" "patriarchy," "Gaton called the" "synthesis," "transsolving."
Those are all kinds of senses.
These people can welcome their senses.
And why is this happening?
One of the two aspects of this problem is very strange.
The vents occur in families, so the Gaton has suggested that there's a mainstream fundamental basis, a genetic ground.
Secondly, the synthesis is about — and I get to my point about the main subjects of this talk, which is the creativity — the synthesis is eight times more frequent among artists, poets, writers and other creative people than in the ordinary population.
Why is that?
I'm going to answer this question.
No one has ever coached her yet.
Okay, what is the synthesis? What causes it?
Well, there's a lot of techniques.
One says they're just crazy.
Well, it's not a very special theory, so we can rebuild it.
The other argument says they're fiction and stupid.
Well, this may be partially true, because it's more oil here in Bank Are van like in San Diego.
(Laughter) Okay. So, based on the third theory — well, let's ask what really in the synthesis? OK?
So what we've found is that brain particles and regions are in the brain, in a peacefully format, right next to themselves.
So we thought, in the brain, there's random shortcut between the color and numbers.
And so, always, when you see the number, you see the damage, and you suffer cyclones.
Remember, why is this happening?
Why would these people have to be accompanied?
Remember, how did I say this is happening in the prisons?
This leads to your clue.
And that's there's a progressive gene, a mutation in the gene that causes this crossage of circles.
As it turns out, each of us, it's been connected everything with everybody.
So each part of the brain is involved with each other area, and those connections are removed to create a distinctive Pakistanic architecture of the adult brain.
So if there's a genius sweeping this overflower and if it comes to the poor department of neighbors's life.
And if it's a case, if it's a case and color, you get a number of color-coded synapses.
If it's hitting angles and colors, you get a sound of a staining synchrony.
Now, it's understandable.
Now, what if this gene is independent everywhere in the brain, so everything is connected?
"Well, think about what artists have, writers and speakers, is the ability to engage metaphoric thinking associated with seemingly disconnected ideas, like," "This is a sun." "Well, normally, you don't hear June is the sun is the sun?"
"I want to say," "schizophrenia" "do it, but that's a different story."
"But the words say," "cooking as a sun," "it's shining as a sun, it's like a sun."
You've just found these connections.
If you assume that this wide variety and ideas exist also in other parts of the brain, then it leads to a bigger slope to metaphorical thinking and creativity in people with the patriarchy.
And that's why eight times the synthesis come between the poets, artists and the authors.
Okay, it's a very frustrating picture of the patriarchy.
The last scenario — just a minute...
(Applause) Okay. I'm going to show you all you're spiders, but you denial it.
Here's something I call the Marrnap School, just as your absad, and B is B, C is C. C.
The different shapes for different kinds of dollars, yeah?
Here you've got the Marucan of the alphabet.
One of them is Kick, the second one is Bush.
Which is the Kikiak and Buland?
How many of you think that's Kik and Buba? Raise your hands.
Well, that's one or two Kenyas.
(Laughter) How many people think that's Bush, Kkiki? Raise your hands.
99 percent of you.
Now, no one's not Marifan, how did you do that?
"It's because you're all created a text engine — a patriarchical alchemer — what's that you're saying," "It's annoying a curve, Kiki, in your hearing mode, irritating warning cells, Kirk, suggests the visually curves —" "The shock of corn" "
This is very important, because you're going to tell you that your brain is tackling something that looks like as dumb lying, but photons in your eye create this shape and the purple cells inside your ear, but the brain is able to take their common tags.
It's a primitive form of action, and now we know that it's dissolved in a phenomenal array of the brain, because when it's impaired, those people ability to create B. King, but also the loss of view in metaphors.
"If you ask that guy, you say," "Isn't all gold, what's going on," "what does that mean?" "Patents answer," "Well, that's yeah and the abundant doesn't mean it's gold."
You have to measure the proportional density, not? So, they're completely cold.
So this area is about 8 xer in higher primates — particularly people, as low old primates.
You get knocked into something very interesting because it's a intersection between hearing, your vision and the dark, and people are huge — and there's something very interesting.
And I think it's the basis for a lot of human skills than an amuse, metaphor and creativity.
All of these questions that philosophers have studied after thousands of years, and scientists have a scientist to start imagining the brain, researching the patients and asking those questions.
Thank you.
(Applause) I'm sorry.
(Laughter)
This story is about how the imagination is serious.
14 years ago, I discovered this regular material, fishing network, which is used by the same way since several centuries.
Today I've been using it to crafts, appropriate, meaningful forms of the size of normal buildings in cities around the world.
I wasn't a person that would do that.
I'd never studied the stigma, the machinery, or architecture.
In fact, I announced the middle school at the seven Olympic schools and refused me to every one of them.
And I decided that I would become an artist to my dog, and I drew all the 10 years, until I got the Fallbnights scholarship into India.
I sent my paintings, I sent my paintings and I came in to Massachadapura.
The mysterious term of the show comes — but my drawings won't.
I had to do something.
This fisher village was a famous stigma.
So I'd been trying to get rid of the caoise.
But bigovers were too heavy and expensive.
I went to the beach, I observed fishing trees in the sandside cafes.
I knew every day, but this time I saw it differently — new access to the sculptures, the way to create a very difficult and solid materials.
My first meets I've developed with these fisheries.
"It's a media story called" "The Little hip." "(Laughter) We've surrendered them to the serack to allow them to take photos."
What I learned was that the surface of the surface revealed every calcium in constantly changing patterns.
I was very disabled.
I was studying the TV traditions and worked with artists, and then in Liton, with the makers of chips.
I liked myself this powerful detail that I thought, but I wanted to scale them out of objects, which you're looking at something you could lose.
I returned to India to work with the fishery fisheries, and we created a network from a million and a half of handwrittens — this is recently installed in May.
Now, thousands of people have seen this, one of them had been a sranky Manll-Morine, who compiled design furniture in Portland, in Portugal.
He asked me if I could build this as a breakfast piece for the city.
I didn't know if I managed to save my arts.
"" "" "" stage, "" thrilled, "" they're a religious whale ambiguous, tar and recreational. "
It took me two years before I found a thread that would value ultraviolet beam, salt air, air, and at the same time, he was chasing his face to move free in the wind.
We needed something that would hold up the network up, in the middle of road transported.
So we've taken this 45,000 pounds of (201) (Laughter) 41 pounds of a circle.
We had to construct it as well as well as possible regained and survived of hurricanes.
We didn't have any aspirational software to make something accelerate and mobility.
I expanded an amazing lesbian machine that was designing the ship for the Gulf Coast boat and called Peter Hoppell.
And I've decided to deal with this two challenge — an emotional shape and equal movement.
I couldn't face it in a way that I knew because hand-in-freatened doors wouldn't leave a hurricane.
So I joined the industrial flow of planting plants, learned how machines worked, and found a way to create a landscape with them.
We didn't have any language that we would have done this old, illegal art reformed on something which can make me worse.
So we created it.
Three years later, two children later, we've drifted this 50,000-million square meter a blob.
It was incredible — what I've imagined now, permanently, and at the same time, nothing terrible happened.
(Applause) This intersection was anything and anonymous.
He's now his clues.
I wished it for the first time.
I was looking at how the wind tissue gradually opens open, I felt disabled and connected to infinite heavens.
My life will never be the same.
I want to make these kinds of sculptures in space all around the world.
I'm going to share two directions that are new in my job.
The Dutch city of Philadelphia: I felt that his miniest needs a material for a cable that would be easier than the web.
So we experimented with the tiny, breaking down particles of water to create a sock, which is shaped by the wind, and by studying, we realized that this could be shaped by people, could move through yourself, move through it without raping.
I'm going to use this circular material like a heat flow of a crab on the surface in real time — like a X-ray of an invading urban vessel system.
Another challenge, the Bible of America in Denver was asked me if I could display the 35 clients of the westerns of the western and their interconnectedness.
(Laughter) I didn't expect where I should start, but I said yes.
I was reading about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that had gone through the whole Pacific Ocean.
It was taken down the ground of the Ethiopian plate, sprubbed the Earth's farm and literally minus the length of the day.
I ended up an NOAA and Animioscientific Choir, and asked them if they would give me the data on leaders, and they applied to something like this.
"The result marks:" "1.26" "is the number of microseconds as much as the south day."
This didn't create a way I knew — steel circles.
This shape was just too complex now.
So I switched a metal published, a hungry stube, whose thread was 15 degrees simulated than steel.
So the software could be completely subtle, because it was so easy, it could connect the existing buildings — it literally becomes part of the city structure.
We didn't have any software that would allow these complex networks and model them with gravity.
So we had to create it.
Then someone from New York City and asked if I could adapt these concepts on the Times Square or High in New York City.
This new structure allows me to model and make these spraptures in the range of carrots.
But they're not touched yet, but now I'm dreaming about putting them in cities around the world where there's most needed.
14 years ago, I was searching beauty in the traditional stuff, in the musical forms.
I'm going to talk to you today with your bars and machines to create meaningful, vocal forms, visions of buildings.
My arts are constantly moving.
I'm going to leave with this story.
She called me a friend from Pentagon.
In offices in the office never anticipated art, never published local works of art, each one who could try to get out of the buildings out of the building and make them easier in the bedroom.
They were in the nurses, they lay on grass, and they were paying attention to the winds, next to the people who didn't know and share the rebuilding of the world wonder.
Thank you.
(Applause) Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
We're reading this graph by looking at your age at a volcanic axis.
Let's kick down a map.
She's six months old.
(Applause)
I became actually myself in the body of Mexico.
If you've ever seen human brain, you know that his two hemispheres are pretty separate.
Thank you. Thank you. It was pleasure. (Speake: That was.)
In the form of energy flowing currently through our sensors, and then explodes into a huge cycle of how this moment looks like this moment in the present and tastes like it tastes and how it sounds like.
I'm energy being associated with energy around me by my right hemisphere.
At this point we're perfect, whole and beautiful.
My left hemisphere — our left hemisphere — is a completely different place.
Our left hemisphere is linear and smogally.
Our left hemisphere is the language.
The only thing I knew was energy — energy.
"" "I asked," "What happened to me?"
And in my body, I felt easier.
